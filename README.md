# Competence_analysis
Data for thesis project.

The Data_Indeed folder contains all the final data, including a dataset containing all the job ID's and relative text links.
It also includes results from all the different algorithms/models used in the project.

The Gather_Data includes three different notebooks: 'receive_html.ipynb', 'analyse.ipynb' and 'master.ipynb'. 'Receive_html.ipynb' extracts jobs from the website Indeed.com in textual format. 'Analyse.ipynb' is responsible for all the pre processing and analysis done in the project. 'Master.ipynb' is a simple wrapper which can be used as a user interface.
