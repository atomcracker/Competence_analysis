Research and development (R&D) is vital to Western Digitalâ€™s success, and to the success of our customers, as we provide the essential storage foundation that enables digital infrastructure, systems and devices around the world. By investing more than $2 billion to R&D in each of our last three fiscal years, our world-class engineering efforts combine technology innovation and leadership with product design and at-scale manufacturing processes to bring products to market in a cost-effective and timely manner with the quality and reliability our customers can trust. 
Analysts predict that by 2024, approximately 150ZB of data will be created, captured, copied and consumed in the world. This is equivalent to ~20TB per each human being living in 2024, assuming 7.5 billion people. This tremendous growth in data requires continued increases in storage capacity and performance for the cloud, big data and consumer technologies. 
Western Digitalâ€™s R&D spans a variety of areas, across its hard disk drives (HDD) and solid-state drive (SSD)/Flash business units. We are developing or have developed heat- and energy-assisted magnetic recording (EAMR), vertical 3D NAND integration of Flash where we recently announced 162-layer 3D NAND technology, NVMe Zoned Namespaces (ZNS) and RISC-V based high-efficiency storage controllers. Additionally, Western Digital research is on the forefront of computational storage, artificial intelligence acceleration technologies, smart networking such as OmniXtend, open-source security projects such as OpenTitan, high-density persistent memory technologies.
