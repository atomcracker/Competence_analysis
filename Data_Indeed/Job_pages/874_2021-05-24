 Program Description:
 Qualified instructors/experts are needed for a new program development. Topics of expertise include but are not limited to: 
 Driving Innovation through Technology and Meaning 
EECS X410.10
 Innovation is driven by new technologies that deliver enhanced meaning and benefit for the end user. While products need to be functional, efficient and at the right price point, products must also resonate with the emotional needs of the customer. In this course, students learn how these types of product breakthroughs occur by reviewing an array of case studies featuring notable innovations. An overview of the organizational structure and culture supporting these breakthrough innovations is also highlighted. Students discover ways to clearly define product meaning and convey those requirements to the rest of the organization via user stories. Likewise, the tools and processes that support highly efficient development of derivative products such as Digital Twin, Model-Based Engineering (MBE), Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and Product Data Management (PDM) are also reviewed. High growth, successful companies innovate continuously through methodologies like Design-Thinking which links inspiration and meaning to the execution of the entire product lifecycle. Innovative technologies such as Decisioning Systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics, Quantum Computing, Fog/Edge Computing, Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM), Optics and Lasers, Autonomous Robotics, Nanotechnology, Cyber Physical Systems, Security Biometrics are also presented in relationship to new product development. 
 Systems Engineering and Technical Project Management
 
EECS X410.11
 The goal of this course is to learn how to manage technical projects using both systems engineering and project management tools and techniques. Differences between the project manager‚Äôs outcomes and responsibilities (schedule, cost, and resources) and those of the system engineer (technical integration, verification and validation) are explored. Each step of the technical project management lifecycle is addressed such as: Initiation (business case and feasibility), Planning, Execution, Monitoring and Control and Closure. The standard project management ‚ÄúWaterfall approach‚Äù is also highlighted. Decomposing and then construction of the ‚ÄúV‚Äù process of product development and integration in systems engineering is also explored using case-based examples. Other effective methodologies, tools and processes often used in engineering and technology project management such as Agile, Iterative, Spiral, Hybrid (using Scrum and Kanban) are reviewed. Students learn from a variety of engineering and technical project management and systems engineering case studies. 
 Students continue to work in groups to build out their plan for the creation of a new (or modified existing) product utilizing a new technology within one of their organizations. Without compromising an organization‚Äôs intellectual property, these plans are formulated under the corresponding section of the Project Charter linked specifically to this course. Corresponding sections are presented for feedback during the course. 
 Innovation and the Technical Professional 
EECS X410.12
 Nearly all innovation within an organization originates from the thinking and behavior of individual employees. This course provides the student with the ability to identify and foster key individual traits that lead to innovative performance. Essential techniques and processes that support creative thought are discussed in the context of the innovation lifecycle (idea landscape, idea generation, idea assessment and idea realization). This course also explores related topics such as ‚ÄúWhy IQ is Not Enough,‚Äù cultivating a creative mindset, managing positive stress to induce creativity, as well as understanding the benefits of leveraging differing cultural approaches to innovation. Specific techniques to effective brainstorming and mind-mapping are also reviewed such as Rohrbach‚Äôs Brain Writing, TRIZ/ARIZ, Reverse Thinking and SCAMPER. Students also discover strategies to mitigate conflict when it does occur, how to conduct flash mentoring to quickly convey tribal knowledge and speed up the innovation process, and ways to influence stakeholders even in the absence of title or authority. 
 
Students continue to work in groups by translating their learning into detailed plans for the creation of a new (or modified) product based on the Project Charter developed in the first class.
