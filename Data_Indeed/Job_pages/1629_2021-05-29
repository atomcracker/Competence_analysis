Beyond Bing other search engines such as Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and new startups like Neeva depend on us as well. 
We have seen little innovation in search in the last decade and we are looking for people who want to build the next generation of search using advanced AI technologies such as deep learning. Our work spans a very large scope of scenarios including delivering high quality search results from a massive document corpus, extractive and abstractive summarization to generate document snippets, personalization, machine reading comprehension, and document recommendations. 
As a team, we leverage the diverse backgrounds and experiences of passionate engineers, scientists, and program managers to help us realize our goal of making the world smarter and more productive. We believe great products are built by inclusive teams of customer-obsessed individuals who trust each other and work closely together. We collaborate regularly across the company both to find the technology breakthroughs from groups like Microsoft Research to infusing AI into the rest of Microsoft products like Office and Azure. 
Some examples of our work include: 
Open sourcing our vector search algorithm (covered by Ars Technica and TechCrunch) 
Using transformer networks for search (covered in Search Engine Land and in State of AI 2020 report) 
Deep learning based question answering and captions (covered in VentureBeat, Search Engine Land) 
Codeveloping our large scale training library called DeepSpeed (covered in SiliconAngle, The Batch) 
Building and open sourcing blazing fast transformer network inferencing (covered in ZDNet and Forbes) including developing our own accelerated chips for inferencing
