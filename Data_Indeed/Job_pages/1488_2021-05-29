The Research and Measurement Sciences (RMS) Foundational Psychometrics and Statistics Research (FPSR) Center in ETSsâ€™ Research & Development (R&D) Division invites applications for an open-rank Research Scientist position. Specifically, we seek scientists in the areas of applied and computational statistics, machine learning, data science, or psychometrics to embark on exciting research to tackle the challenges of learning and assessment in the digital age. In this era, four realities will dominate assessment:
 Digitally based assessments
 Large volumes of data collected through test takersâ€™ assessment actions
 Large volumes of other data about individuals who are being assessed
 The growing capabilities of artificial intelligence.
 We have launched new research initiatives to prepare ETS to thrive in the face of these realities, and we are looking for research scientists from multiple quantitative disciplines to lead these initiatives alongside the national leaders in assessment, psychometrics and statistics who make up our current staff.
 The research in FPSR will focus on the following research areas:
 Next generation psychometrics for assessment and learning
 Individualized learning and assessment
 Modelling response processes and sequences of actions
 Modelling educational big data
 Advanced psychometric modeling for assessing complex constructs
 Automated item generation
 Digital assessment design, validity and fairness
 Fairness and score comparability in AI based scoring and digital assessments
 Fairness in assessments across cultures and languages
 Adaptive assessment design
 Advancing survey based group-score assessments
 Modernizing group-score analysis methods and matrix sampling of assessment items
 Responsibilities: 
Develop novel psychometric, statistical, artificial intelligence, or machine learning methods for learning and assessment data.
 Design and conduct scientific studies related to the focus areas of the RMS Research Initiative.
 Consult and collaborate on problems related to the scientistâ€™s expertise that arise in the context of other ETS research, ETS testing programs, or ETS corporate management concerns.
 Pursue or collaborate in interdisciplinary projects, transferring techniques to new contexts or connecting scientific fields that are usually separate.
 Serve as a subject matter expert in representing research results and the RMS Research Initiative to ETS corporate leadership, clients, and potential funding agencies.
 Develop or assist in developing proposals for external and internal research grants and obtain financial support for new or continuing research activities. Prepare initial and final proposal and project budgets.
 Contribute to advancing innovations in operational assessment programs.
 Manage staff and budgets for research project and grants.
 Mentor junior staff, including research assistants and interns, guiding their work, providing counsel, and facilitating collaboration.
 Participate in dissemination activities by publishing papers in peer-reviewed journals and in the ETS Research Report series; issuing progress and technical reports; presenting seminars at major conferences and at ETS; or using other appropriate communication platforms (e.g., social media or books and chapters) that impact practice in the field or at ETS.
 Develop professional relationships as a representative, consultant or advisor to external advisory and policy boards and councils, research organizations, educational institutions and educators.
 Provide professional leadership in and foster collaboration within the research community at large.
