 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search GPU Advocate NALA NVIDIA 238 reviews Pennsylvania Remote NVIDIA 238 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. Job Company Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description High Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are key markets for NVIDIA. Researchers and scientists are actively embracing GPU programming to accelerate their research. To help them with onboarding to GPUs, in partnership with national laboratories and universities, NVIDIA is leading a series of GPU hackathons and bootcamps. Hackathons are shortâ€”typically week longâ€”intensive coding sessions where experienced mentors team up with groups of researchers to guide through acceleration or optimizing of their projects on GPUs using a variety of programming models and tools.
 With fast growing demand for GPU use in the scientific community, we are looking for a GPU Advocate to own the rapidly growing GPU hackathon program.
 In this position you will craft the complete experience of GPU hackathon attendees, as you will schedule, facilitate, mentor and track participant progress; you will closely collaborate with scientists at universities, supercomputing centers and other organizations to help their users start using GPUs for their work or optimize codes on GPUs, promote their research, and build a growing community. You will moderate and mentor at hackathons, run GPU Bootcamps and help craft materials to educate attendees and prepare them for hackathons. Your responsibilities will include driving events for HPC, AI and Data scientists, documenting and tracking progress of each coder over time, and where applicable, help build assets that promote the resulting success stories.
 Do you have a passion for science, connecting people, and teaching? If so, we wish to talk with you right away!
 What youâ€™ll be doing:
 Recruit sites that will host successful hackathons/bootcamps and guide their team members through the planning process
 Assess resource requirements of each hackathon and identify any gaps to delivering a quality experience for all participants
 Identify and recruit key codes to participate in collaboration with hosting sites, national labs and NVIDIA teams
 Assist with identifying and recruiting mentors
 Moderate events, build and refine training materials, and mentor team members at the events
 Secure and manage when needed GPU cluster resources for events
 Write comprehensive internal feedback reports and find opportunities for improvements
 Promote event successes through publishing blogs and papers, facilitating presentations, and using other media that convey the impact of the work accomplished by teams at the hackathons
 Support ongoing post-event communications with hackathon attendees and mentors to track team progress, assist with further GPU porting and inform readers of mentor opportunities
 Deliver feedback to tool providers and other partners in the form of lessons learned that would facilitate adoption and use of GPUs
 What we need to see:
 Bachelor's degree in Science or Computer Engineering or equivalent experience
 8+ years work experience as a program, community manager with experience of organizing and running training events.
 HPC/computational science background
 Capability to think strategically, while jumping directly into day-to-day event and account management
 Ability to thrive in a highly dynamic environment and to lead change through multi-functional teamwork
 Proven ability to understand the goals of a number of partners, and distill that feedback into an action plan that addresses core needs
 Excellent verbal, written communication, and interpersonal skills
 Ways to stand out from the crowd:
 PhD is preferred
 Experience in AI and Data Science
 Experience in facilitating group training events
 Fluent in GPU programming
 Passion for data management
