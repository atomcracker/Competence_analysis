 Job Description 
 We have an opening for a staff scientist in the area of quantitative and computational biology. Opportunities exist to further scientific understanding of the genetic and environmental determinants of quantitative traits contributing to fitness, cognitive performance, metabolic output, disease susceptibility, and resistance to other cytological stressors. You will develop new methods, tools, and workflows for analysis of molecular and phenotypic data to identify biomarkers that are correlated with health and disease phenotypes. The selected candidate will also exploit real-world data sets to obtain insight into biological phenomena of interest. This position is in the Genomics group in the Biosciences and Biotechnology Division. 
In this role you will: 
Apply statistical analyses and develop predictive models to understand a diverse range of quantitative traits and human phenotypes. 
Design and conduct complex computational analyses of diverse datasets including phenotypic, molecular and metabolic data, such as generated by biosensors, bioimaging, whole genome DNA sequencing-based genomics data, and mass spectrometry metabolomics and proteomics data. 
Research, design, and implement analysis techniques and computing approaches to model interactions between molecular and metabolic factors to identify trends and predict disease outcomes. 
Perform quality analysis, quality control, and other independent tests of third-party algorithms, analysis methods, and data collection procedures and verify validity of results. 
Pursue independent (but complementary) research interests and interact with a broad spectrum of scientists internally and externally to the Laboratory. 
Publish research results in peer-reviewed scientific or technical journals and present results at external conferences seminars and/or technical meetings. 
Organize, analyze, and present data from research at seminars, technical meetings, national and international conferences. 
 Qualifications 
 Ph.D. in computational biology, computational neuroscience, applied mathematics, bioinformatics, or a related field, or equivalent level of demonstrated knowledge and relevant experience. 
Significant experience in quantitative and computational biology 
Ability to develop and apply novel analytic techniques and modeling approaches to the study of living systems. 
Experience with statistical analysis and data visualization. 
Familiarity with quantitative phenotyping assays, to include tests of cognitive ability, athletic performance, working memory, and executive function. 
Ability to develop independent research projects in quantitative and computational biology, as demonstrated through publication of peer-reviewed literature. 
Advanced verbal and written communication and interpersonal skills to collaborate effectively in a multidisciplinary team environment and present and explain technical information. 
Qualifications we desire: 
Experience with containerization toolkits such as Docker or Singularity and familiarity with high performance computing environments, including experience with workload managers such as Slurm, PBS/Torque, or Kubernetes. 
Experience with quantitative health analytics and systems biology and multi-omics data analysis. 
Experience with Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and applications to biological data.
