 Summary 
 Due to the Pandemic and individual states with different phases of reopening, the selecteeâ€™s report date to the 
official duty station/facility may be delayed until such time as employees are allowed to report to the workplace. 
The person selected may telework up to the maximum extent possible, up to and including full time, until it is 
determined by state and Federal officials that employees are allowed to report to the workplace where this 
position is located, on a regular basis. 
 
 Responsibilities 
 Responsible for evaluating artificial intelligence systems compliance to applicable regulations, policy, and industry standards. As an expert in aircraft artificial intelligence systems, the incumbent recognizes the need for new rules that may be necessary for new state of the art equipment or aircraft installations. The incumbent will provide policy and guidance for domestic and international consideration for standardization. Initiates, organizes, and conducts the development of new or modified Federal Aviation Regulations pertaining to artificial intelligence systems. Participates in Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committees/Aviation Rulemaking Committees to draft new rules and ad hoc teams with industry, other aviation authorities, and agencies to develop regulations, policies and standards. Evaluates the design of artificial intelligence systems, and where necessary, participates in the analysis of accident, malfunction, and service difficulty reports involving artificial intelligence systems. 
Incumbent plans and accomplishes highly complex and challenging projects and other work activities under the minimal direction of a manager. Applies experience and comprehensive professional knowledge of aerospace engineering principles, theories, and concepts, as well as an understanding of new technologies and methodologies, to solve complex problems and to develop improved technical processes for the organization. Works closely with Policy & Innovation Division management, internal FAA stakeholders and external stakeholders (i.e., industry, other aviation authorities, etc.) to address challenges with emerging technologies. Identifies and participates in research and development studies to ascertain the need for new safety standards or to implement new technologies to improve continued operational safety (COS). Develop mutually rewarding relationships with fellow employees, industry, and stakeholders. All corporate activities are conducted to the highest ethical standards by communicating effectively, remaining flexible, respecting differing opinions, and exercising patience in challenging situations. 
Contacts are both internal and external. Incumbent coordinates with FAA technical specialists and industry members to facilitate technical discussions and negotiate consensus solutions that benefit the general public, aircraft operators, and manufacturers. Develops, integrates and implements solutions to diverse, complex problems that frequently require working across functional and/or organizational lines. Applies systems thinking to the above responsibilities. The FAA is moving to a systems based approach to oversight of the aviation industry and it is essential to evaluate large/complex delegated organizations, as well as smaller delegated entities, and efficiently and effectively oversee these entities based upon risk to operation within the aviation system. 
Broad policies and objectives provide general guidance for addressing issues, but allow considerable discretion to develop new and innovative approaches. Draws on experience to solve unusual problems and may create new solutions and policy 
interpretations as the situation requires. Provides policy guidance and instruction to others, both internally and externally. 
Provides guidance to lower-level staff to solve difficult technical issues. Resolves all but unique technical problems without the intervention of management or a more experienced engineer. Develops plans, techniques, and policies to address current or anticipated problems and issues. Works with senior management to solve problems. 
Work is reviewed rarely, typically through status reports and at project completion, to ensure technical compliance and alignment with the requirements of the project or other work activity. 
Work activities typically impact directly on the objectives of one or more major subdivisions and/or LOB's/SO's and may impact on the objectives of the FAA.
