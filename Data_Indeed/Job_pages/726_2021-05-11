The EPA National Student Services Contract has an immediate opening for a full time Software Development Support position with the Office of Research and Development at the EPA facility in Research Triangle Park, NC.
 The Office of Research and Development at the EPA supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. Research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in EPA laboratories and at universities across the country.
 What the EPA project is about 
The Center for Environmental Solutions and Emergency Response (CESER) plans, coordinates and conducts an applied, customer-driven, national research and development program to improve decision making by EPA, federal, state, tribal and local agencies, when faced with challenging environmental problems in the built environment. Within CESER, the Homeland Security and Materials Management Division (HSMMD) conducts an applied, customer-driven, national-scale research program to improve the nationâ€™s preparedness for and response to environmental emergencies and materials management challenges. 
The Homeland Security Research Program (HSRP) is responsible for addressing the research needs associated with EPA fulling its Homeland Security related responsibilities. These responsibilities include preparing for and have capabilities to support response to environmental contamination that threatens public health resulting from a disaster. HSRP staff work closely with their EPA partners and other federal, state, and local stakeholders to understand response/remediation needs and to (in part) develop capabilities for supporting emergency response and recovery capabilities through innovative technologies, such as automation, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. HSRP is currently exploring two separate efforts that make use of these technologies: 1) computer vision/sensing for tracking resources by means of a QR code scanning or radio-frequency identification (RFID); and 2) the use of artificial intelligence for identifying infrastructure through publicly available imagery (e.g., imagery derived from cell phones, cameras, and Google Street View). 
What experience and skills will you gain? 
As a team member, you will provide development support to the continued enhancement and further development of the HSRPâ€™s resource tracking application and the use of artificial intelligence for improving decision making. The student shall also support the development and expansion of these efforts to support the needs of EPA emergency response programs. These research efforts are defined as the following: 
Computer vision/sensing for tracking resources: The HSRP has developed a tool for tracking assets (e.g., people, equipment) through the use of QR codes. The system uses USB-interface webcams along with the open-source python-based software for scanning and generating QR codes. The system was designed to read QR codes attached to assets. QR stations (consisting of a laptop and webcam) can be staged at various locations for the purpose of tracking an entity for logistical and health and safety purposes. The student shall investigate and implement options for expanding this system to communicate with a web-based or networked system for storing and monitoring these records. Furthermore, the student shall investigate other technologies for tracking assets (e.g., radio-frequency identification (RFID) and computer vision technologies). The student shall work with EPAâ€™s Office of Emergency Management and EPA Regions to implement additional features and fixes as needed. 
 
Artificial intelligence: the student shall explore the use of artificial intelligence (e.g., neural networks, machine vision, and fuzzy logic) for identifying infrastructure using publicly available imagery (e.g., imagery derived from cell phones, cameras, and Google Street View). The system shall determine the type of infrastructure (e.g., residence, business, hospital) and provide an estimate of construction material based on the characteristics of the building. This application will be used to supplement decontamination and waste management activities following an incident. The student contractor shall work with researchers to develop the code and tests for evaluating the accuracy of the application. 
Responsibilities:
 
Research and Development Responsibilities shall include: 
Understand and apply software and hardware for the purpose of collecting and storing information using computer vision and other sensors; 
Apply innovative approaches for designing and developing applications; 
Work with a wide range of programming languages and hardware for developing novel applications; 
Understand and apply artificial intelligence capabilities and best practices through open source code; and 
Identify and develop enhancements and additional functionality/capabilities to meet planning, implementation and data acquisition needs. 
Communications-related responsibilities shall include: 
Participate as a member of the research planning and software development team; 
Support needs of the project team to provide input to required Information Technology (IT) data requirements that ORD or other parts of the EPA (e.g., Office of Environmental Information) require to perform IT-related activities;

Interact with program leadership and researchers to understand stakeholder needs; 
Work with stakeholders and end-users to address bugs and conduct application support; and
