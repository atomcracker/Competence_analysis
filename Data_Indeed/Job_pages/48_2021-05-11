 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Account Executive â€“ Ohio and Western Pennsylvania (REMOTE) NICE Columbus, OH Remote Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description You are fearless â€” eager to run through walls but smart enough to find the hidden doorway behind the library shelf. 
You are generous â€” you hold that door open for the next person too. 
We want to know: Are you NICE? 
 
 This is a REMOTE role, traveling to clients in Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. 
NICE Ltd is a publicly traded tech leader with a market cap of $7 Billion. We are seeking a consultative, collaborative Account Executive to largely act as a hunter targeting enterprise accounts in the Ohio and western PA market. About 25% of the accounts have existing business, with the remaining ~75% of the book being a combo of warm and cold relationships not currently doing substantial business. 
This role reports into a Regional Vice President who highly values creativity, tenacity, positivity, and honesty. He has many years of developing teams and understands investing in his employees. 
You will be well-positioned for success if you have a history of successfully executing multi-million dollar deals, targeting an audience of C-suite decision-makers in enterprise organizations. There is no industry verticalization-the territory is your oyster. Further, the AE can sell across our entire portfolio, which is both large and highly complex, so it is critical that you understand how to build detailed sales strategies that comprehensively analyze the customerâ€™s business, allowing you to anticipate client needs and proactively present a highly differentiated value proposition.
