 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Computational Multiphysics Engineer Los Alamos National Laboratory 271 reviews Los Alamos, NM Los Alamos National Laboratory 271 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. What You Will Do
 The work we do at Los Alamos National Laboratory delivers science, engineering, applied mathematics, and technology to protect our nation and promote world stability. In the Advanced Engineering Analysis Group (W-13) we lead the development of computational engineering solutions and expertise in support of national security challenges.
 We strive to provide our national security customers with timely and accurate answers to complex engineering problems by creatively combining cutting-edge numerical tools across collaborative teams. Our customers include the nuclear weapons program, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense, among others. Our group expertise includes structural mechanics, structural dynamics, heat transfer, radiation transport, thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, probabilistic methods, material modeling, and numerical analysis.
 R&D Engineer 2 ($94,100 - $155,700)
 We have a need for expertise in development and application of multi-physics approaches to address complex, novel engineering challenges to advance engineering science as well as to address practical questions related to the broad disciplines and customers listed above. As a competitive candidate you will have proven experience with the development and application of multi-physics methods and codes, particularly in large-scale computing environments. You will work collaboratively with test leads, system engineers, and other analysts to develop, validate, apply models and workflows, and communicate results to customers and stakeholders. You will also work collaboratively with workflow developers to guide capability requirements and perform engineering analysis studies. Team collaborations will be facilitated via software productivity tools (e.g., Confluence and git).
 R&D Engineer 3 ($113,100 - $190,900)
 In addition to what was described at the R&D Engineer 2 level, at the R&D Engineer 3 level will be expected to lead collaborative teams in technical work and lead brainstorming sessions across disciplines and perspectives to find the best analysis approach. You will be expected to define and execute strategic plans with both team members and customers to maintain and improve system model capabilities while also developing key future capabilities that enable us to support the LANL mission. 
 
 
 What You Need
 Minimum Job Requirements:
 Engineering Expertise
 A documented record of technical achievement in a relevant engineering discipline, such as mechanical, structural, civil, nuclear, aerospace, metallurgy, or material science; ability to perform engineering analysis at an appropriate level ranging from hand calculations through system-level modeling. Creative thinking showing an ability to span multiple space and time scales will be required.
 Computational Skills
 Experience with the development and/or application of computational engineering methods and tools, particularly in parallel computing environments; experience with mesh generation practices; deep experience in computational methods and use of open-source programming languages and libraries. Knowledge of publication-quality 2D visualization methods with 3D visualization experience a plus.
 Communication and Teamwork
 Demonstrated strong oral and written communication skills, particularly in technical reports, presentations, and released code; experience defining and meeting deliverable deadlines, both independently and as part of a team.
 Additional Job Requirements for R&D 3:
 In addition to the requirements outlined above, qualification at the higher level requires:
 Relevant Work Experience
 Significant amount (> 5 years) of experience performing complex engineering analyses or related R&D, preferably at both component- and system-levels. First-author publication of scientific journal articles or project leadership reports.
 Technical Leadership
 Demonstrated experience leading engineering analysis teams, strategic planning and/or proposal development, integrating and coordinating interdisciplinary work, and working with customers and other stakeholders to define analysis tasks and plan deliverables.
 Education for R&D Engineer 2:  Position requires a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Engineering from an ABET accredited institution and 4 years of related experience; or, an equivalent combination of education and experience directly related to the occupation.
 Education for R&D Engineer 3:  Position requires a Master‚Äôs Degree in Engineering from an ABET accredited institution and 6 years of related experience; or, an equivalent combination of engineering education and experience directly related to the occupation. At this level a Ph.D. may be preferred.
 Desired Qualifications:
 Verification and Validation
 Demonstrated experience with the verification and/or validation of complex computational models and simulation results. For example, use of idealized models to illustrate physical phenomena to explain experimental data. Use of quantatitive metrics to assess model performance.
 Statistical and/or Probabilistic Analysis
 Demonstrated experience with the application of statistical and/or probabilistic methods within the context of engineering analysis. Experience with machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches, particularly within a V&V context, is preferred.
 Experience with Programming and/or Code Development
 Experience with usage and/or code development in modern programming languages (e.g. Python, C++, MatLab, Julia) and their application to scientific computing (e.g. automation, pre/post processing, data analysis, file I/O, parallel computing, BitBucket, GitLab, Jira, Jenkins). Experience with, object oriented programming approaches, build systems, unit testing, and wrapped compiled languages (e.g,. wrapped C in python) is desired.
 End-to-end, ‚ÄúFull Ftack‚Äù Project Experience
 Demonstrated end-to-end project experience from conception, to conceptual planning, to design, to build/deployment, to testing, to analysis and publication is preferred. An ideal candidate will be able to meet low- to high-level needs within a project (especially at the R&D 3 level) in order to enable project success, even in the face of unexpected difficulties.
 Active Q Clearance or Equivalent
