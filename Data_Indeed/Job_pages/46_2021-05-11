 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Executive Assistant kapwing San Francisco, CA Remote Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description Video editing is the final frontier of software tools moving to the cloud. Our work of making next-gen tools for today's creators is a challenging, but important endeavor. Join us at Kapwing on our mission to make content creation easy, accessible, and collaborative. 
Everyone is a creator. The problem, however, is that today's tools get in the way of expressing our creativity fully. Especially when it comes to video, the gap between an idea and a video is wide enough that it's hard to even start. 
Our mission at Kapwing is to make content creation easier and more accessible. Our main product, Kapwing Studio, is an online video editor that is both powerful and easy to use. Millions of creators every month choose Kapwing to tell their story and bring their ideas to life. 
 
 Our vision is to build a modern video editing platform that serves as the go-to tool for anyone creating video for Youtube, social media, or work. Being in the browser allows us to turn video editing, a traditionally heavyweight, time consuming workflow, into a joyful, collaborative, and fully-featured experience. We believe that we can use technology to augment the video editing and content creation experience, and we've already started on this path with a wide array of templates, applications of artificial intelligence, and new pipelines for exporting and video processing. 
 
 While software is the core of our product, being creative is the core of our work. Every team at Kapwing, from engineering to content to customer success, values trying new things, moving quickly, and helping creators in new ways. With remote work, remote learning, an economic downturn and the rise of social media as a political advocacy channel, video and media entrepreneurship have never been more relevant for the world. Join us on our journey to democratize creative tools and invent the future stack of video creation.
