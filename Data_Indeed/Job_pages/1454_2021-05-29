 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Computational Project Scientist Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 171 reviews San Francisco Bay Area, CA Temporarily remote Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 171 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description Berkeley Labâ€™s CAMERA (Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Applications) has a new opening for a Project Scientist to develop mathematical algorithms and related software from Applied Mathematics, Computational Sciences and/or Data Science to work on designing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques (AI/ML) for the automation of counting and structure analysis from microscopic images coming from one or more instruments, using visible light as well as other wavelengths used for imaging samples of interest to the Department of Energy (DOE), e.g. infra-red, ultra-violet, X-ray, etc. The Project Scientist will combine mathematics, statistics with new machine learning, and automation to image analysis tasks needed within the laboratory, for example, in quality control of materials imaged at the Advanced Light Source, Molecular Foundry and other facilities within the laboratory. The successful candidate will work as part of a collaborative team to integrate sample metrology into quantitative computational models able to predict the outcome of experimental approaches, as well as to evaluate, develop and apply automation solutions to organize these data. The Project Scientist will be working closely with bench scientists, automation engineers and software developers in devising methods for high-throughput data analysis for feedback into experimental design, as part of CAMERA allied to other centers, programs and/or stakeholders. 
The core values of CAMERA reflect a strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We seek candidates who will support a culture in which the entire CAMERA community feels welcomed and valued. An ongoing commitment to recruiting a vibrant, diverse and talented workforce is paramount to promoting a diverse lab community. 
What You Will Do: 
The project scientist will join in the design, development, and optimizations of AI/ML data driven models. 
Develop quantitative predictive models based on scientific data sets and incorporate them into a multi-modal technique database(s). 
Spearhead a focused effort to enhance data acquisition and management frameworks, query processed and analyzed data, access data from multiple instruments and facilities in a unified way, and relate these data to one another in support of multi-modal analyses. 
Use machine-learning approaches to predict outcomes based on scientific data using state-of-the-art computing infrastructure, e.g., NERSC. 
Work closely with CAMERA scientists to deploy and evaluate the software. 
Provide training to colleagues and write excellent documentation, to elevate the work from a proof of concept to maintainable, long-lasting infrastructure. 
Develop ML models that take data from a variety of sources to promote materials discovery. 
What is Required: 
Masterâ€™s degree or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Data Science or Mathematics, or an equivalent combination of education and experience. 
3 years of relevant experience beyond a degree in Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, data Science or a closely related discipline. 
Experience and a strong interest in scientific software development or research software engineering. 
Experience using the open-source scientific Python software stack for data analysis. 
Demonstrated record of scientific excellence through publications, talks, or software deliverables. 
Demonstrated knowledge of AI/ML/DL principles and practices, and familiarity with widely-used AI/ML libraries such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. 
Experience contributing to a scientific software project in a team environment, which might include co-developing an internal project or contributing to community-based open source software. 
Experience in developing new mathematical algorithms for data analysis, statistical models, computer vision and image processing, including significant expertise in algorithmic development for two or more of the following experimental techniques: tomography, optical microscopy, electron microscopy. 
Demonstrated expertise in applying image processing methods to biological images. 
Experience in developing open source code in areas such as quantitative microscopy, management, and/or visualization. 
Significant experience with the Scientific Python software stack, including experience in using AI/ML/DL packages. 
Familiarity with software version control systems (git, github, bitbucket) and automated documentation systems (sphinx etc.). 
Desired Qualifications: 
Contributions to open-source scientific software projects. 
Experience creating data analysis methods and procedures. 
Demonstrated record in collaborative software development, especially in distributed teams. 
Experience in data acquisition and analysis of micrographies. 
Experience in data management. 
Notes: 
This is a full-time 2 year, term appointment that may be renewed to a maximum of five years. 
This position may be subject to a background check. Any convictions will be evaluated to determine if they directly relate to the responsibilities and requirements of the position. Having a conviction history will not automatically disqualify an applicant from being considered for employment. 
This position will be remote initially, but limited to individuals residing in the United States tentatively until 2021 due to COVID-19. Once the Bay Area shelter-in-place restrictions are lifted, work will be primarily performed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, CA.
