A postdoctoral research associate or more senior research position is available at Princeton University in the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, working in the research group led by Assistant Professor Kelsey Hatzell. Research is focused on high temperature energy storage and heat-transfer media for concentrated solar power. Responsibilities include planning and performing experiments, visualization of data, image analysis, and manuscript and report preparation. The project requires applicants to have a strong background in heat transfer and a willingness to learn advanced x-ray imaging techniques. Experience with COMSOL Multiphysics and machine learning or artificial intelligence is desirable, but not necessary.
Individuals with a Ph.D. in relevant fields (including mechanical engineering, material science, chemical engineering, and/or electrical engineering) and expertise in thermal materials, thermal energy storage, high temperature heat exchangers, and/or x-ray tomography techniques are desirable. All candidates must have a strong research background and enjoy working on teams.

The appointment will be for one year, with one year planned renewal contingent on performance and funding.
