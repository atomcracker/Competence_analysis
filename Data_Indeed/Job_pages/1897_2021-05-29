We are looking for qualified candidates to design and execute a wide array of customer-driven research and development efforts employing advanced theoretical/computational research principles, to be exercised in an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) environment. At the broadest level the role will utilize sound scientific knowledge to accelerate traditional research timelines and design, develop, enable the deployment, and support transition of capabilities to address near term national defense, warfighter, and other government requirements. 
 
This opportunity will be centered on the development and application of advanced computational modeling - AI/ML capabilities - to Photonics-related novel materials, components, and process-related design and control capabilities. Fundamental physics, chemistry, engineering, and materials principles will be applied in a custom-designed computational environment to expedite modeling and simulations, driving magnitudes of order reduction in time required to achieve results. 
 
Roles and Responsibilities 
 
The successful candidate will implement fundamental scientific principles and sound logic, combining theoretical and experimental concepts, in a computational lab to foster discovery and definition of novel materials, structures, processes, and device designs. This will entail: 
Utilizing and augmenting open-source computational code, and/or designing (programming) novel computer code 
Working with limited data sets to model material/structure/device/process parameters 
Working design concepts through reverse engineering practice 
Working with unlimited data sets to cull design of material/structure/devices 
Designing and implementing virtual verification and validation of novel models created 
Collaborating with internal and external teammates, customers, and partners to create objectives and work plans, review designs, support experimentation, and/or transition technical designs 
Leads or supports concept development, including participating in technical work proposals 
Attending/presenting at technical conferences (posters or briefings)

Education, Experience and Skills 
PhD in directly related technical field including physics, chemistry, materials science, optics, or related engineering disciplines. 
Research experience in novel materials or processes, with approximately 50% (or more) theoretical/computational methods employed 
Programming in multiple languages (C++, Python, Fortran, TensorFlow, Julia, etc. Advanced experience in AI/ML programming is not required, training will be available) 
Published scientific journal articles 
Scientific conference presentations/posters. 
Excellent written and oral communication 
 
Physical Requirements / Travel 
Normal office environment 
0-5% to CONUS locations. Telecommuting may be permissible during pandemic.
