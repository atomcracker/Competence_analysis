 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Electron Microscopy Postdoc Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 172 reviews San Francisco Bay Area, CA Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 172 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description Berkeley Labâ€™s Materials Sciences Division has an opening for an Electron Microscopy EELS Postdoc. 
 The National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) facility in the Molecular Foundry is one of the world's foremost user facilities for electron beam nanocharacterization, providing state-of-the-art electron microscopes and expertise in high-resolution imaging, spectroscopy, and analysis. The postdoctoral fellow associated with this position will participate in the development and application of new analysis methods for the analysis and noise reduction of Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopic data based on machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) approaches. You will be part of a team-centered around the multi-PI, multi-institution 4DCamera Distillery project led by the Molecular Foundry to develop and deploy AI/ML tools to rapidly distill information from the data streams of fast electron detectors for a variety of imaging, diffraction, spectroscopic, and instrument automation applications. You will also utilize the leading-edge transmission electron microscopy (TEM) capabilities of our facility, including aberration correction and advanced pixelated direct electron detectors utilized for EELS data generation. Key to the success of this project will also be the development of robust analysis codes to quantitatively interpret very large datasets and compare against first-principles simulations, such as those within the Materials Project database. This is a 2-year appointment with the possibility of renewal. 
 What You Will Do: 
 Perform world-class research by developing EELS analysis methods to understand the structure-property relationships of energy-relevant materials by extracting local composition and bonding information from large-scale, noisy datasets. 
 Develop new and innovative analysis methods that apply ML/AI tools for interpretation of fine structure in EELS data. 
 Develop new and innovative analysis methods that apply ML/AI tools for noise reduction of both individual EELS spectra and multidimensional spectral maps. 
 Develop methods for matching EELS data against pre-simulated first principles libraries to determine oxidation state, bond hybridization, and composition of materials. 
 Provide feedback to optimize EELS experimental parameters for maximal information retrieval 
 Collection of experimental EELS data using the suite of FEI Titan-class TEMs available at the NCEM facility 
 Additional Responsibilities as needed: 
 Coordination with the Materials Project at LBNL to aid the specification and development of efficient algorithms for matching experimental EELS data to pre-simulated databases. 
 Incorporation of analysis codes into the software stack for future fast EELS detectors, operating up to MHz speeds. 
 
 What is Required: 
 Ph.D. or equivalent degree in Materials Science, Physics, or related Physical Sciences or Engineering discipline 
 Excellent scientific publications record in relevant areas 
 Experience in the application of machine learning and/or artificial intelligence methods for the analysis of imaging or spectroscopic data. 
 Well-developed oral and written communication skills. Ability to work effectively within a team and with various levels of internal and external users and staff. 
 Strong organizational and time management skills. Ability to manage competing priorities, provide quality work within tight time constraints, and deliver projects on schedule. 
 
 Desired Qualifications: 
 Experience with computational materials modeling such as density functional theory, molecular dynamics, etc. 
 Experience in the management and manipulation of large, multidimensional data sets commensurate with electron microscopy and spectroscopy 
 Experience in the operation of aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopes, particularly in STEM mode 
 Ability to prepare high-quality samples for transmission electron microscopy experiments 
 
 This position will remain open until filled. 
 Notes: 
 This is a full-time, 2 year, postdoctoral appointment with the possibility of renewal based upon satisfactory job performance, continuing availability of funds, and ongoing operational needs. 
 You must have less than 3 years of paid postdoctoral experience. 
 Salary for Postdoctoral positions depends on years of experience post-degree. 
 Salary will be predetermined based on postdoctoral step rates. 
 This position may be subject to a background check. Any convictions will be evaluated to determine if they directly relate to the responsibilities and requirements of the position. Having a conviction history will not automatically disqualify an applicant from being considered for employment.
