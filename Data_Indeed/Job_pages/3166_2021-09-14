Duke Science and Technology (DST) is a signature initiative supported by significant philanthropic investment that involves strategic recruitment of exceptional faculty in three broadly defined focus areas: Computing, Materials Science and Engineering, and Resilience of the Body and Brain. Although junior candidates are preferred, tenure-track faculty openings are available at all levels with appointments in one or more of the following departments in Trinity College of Arts & Science and the Pratt School of Engineering: Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Evolutionary Anthropology, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Physics, Psychology and Neuroscience, and Statistical Science. Cross-school and cross-department appointments are possible. 
 
While we are open to research expertise in any of the three themes, specific interests include: 
 
Computing - Thinking and Learning in the Digital Age:  Computing enables a wide range of scientific discoveries across disciplines at Duke. We want to build upon excellence in cybersecurity and privacy, data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning, causal discovery, AI in Health, quantum computing, autonomous systems, and Internet of Things. 
 
Materials Science - Designing a Better World:  Materials Science and Engineering seeks to strengthen and expand fundamental and applied research priorities in soft and biomaterials, metamaterials, materials for energy and sustainability, and at the interface of artificial intelligence with materials. In these priority areas, the faculty embraces a proven ecosystem of collaboration across disciplines and champions Materials Science and Engineering to meet the pressing societal needs of the future with novel devices, tools, and applications. 
 
Resilience - Fortifying the Body and Brain:  By understanding how biological systems positively adapt to stress or trauma, we can develop new approaches to treat diseases. We are particularly interested in candidates who apply novel conceptual, genomic, and other experimental approaches to key fundamental questions in human biology and medicine.
