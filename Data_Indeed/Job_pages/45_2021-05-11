A self-paced curriculum guided by mentors trained in machine learning; 
Participation in an exciting AI Create-a-thon in cross-discipline and cross-age teams, once again guided by mentors. 
Opportunity to attend seminars on career development skills; attend talks by AI industry professionals and engage in formal and informal peer-networking.
