 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Software Developer: University Hire DevRev Austin, TX DevRev 
 
DevRev is bringing AI and Design to software and customer reliability engineering.  Dev elopers are currently too far away from  Rev enue, resulting in an acutely project-centric (inward-looking) engineering culture that lacks customer empathy. Moreover, the current state of the software industry is extremely inefficient and wasteful - hundreds of billions of dollars are spent in software maintenance. Like self-driving cars, machines are capable of making many engineering chores autonomous. We at DevRev believe that harnessing the knowledge of engineers to build a knowledge-centric system will go a long way in making this industry more product- and customer-centric. 
 
The company recently raised a $50MM seed round, and is being run by founders who have taken companies public on NASDAQ from scratch. DevRev is solving a difficult AI and design problem, and the early employees are committed to the marathon of company-building and hard problem-solving.
