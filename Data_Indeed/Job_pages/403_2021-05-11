Weâ€™re looking for a strong Frontend Engineer to help us build new interfaces for content creation. The best fit for this role has an eye for good design and smooth interactivity, strives to write clean and maintainable code, and has a deep interest in the future of creative tools and browser technologies.

About the company 
Runway is building the next generation of creative tools. We are a small team of artists, engineers, developers, and researchers working together to predict-by-inventing the future. Our team members used to work at NYU, Disney Research, IBM Research, Linode, and Stanford. 
We've built a tool that makes machine learning easy and accessible for all types of creatives. And our users love it. But our vision is bigger. We are transforming how content and media is created. For decades, media creation has relied on incremental iterations of the same old tools. And while some of those tools have become  smarter  in recent years, they're still very much rooted in an outdated paradigm. We've been stuck with the same old  Creative Suite  for way too long. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will not just bring automation at every scale, but a significant change in  how  we create. That's why Runway is reimagining how we create, so we can create new things. 
 
Runway has an active and growing community of artists and creators all over the world. IBM, Google, R/GA, New Balance, Chanel, and dozen of companies are using Runway to create and explore new creative boundaries. Runway is also used to teach at a wide variety of institutions. From architectural programs at MIT to self-organized independent workshops in PerÃº. 
We are a young company and this role is a unique opportunity to join a market-defining company in its early stages.
 Requirements 
Knowledge of TypeScript, React, and modern web UI development frameworks. 
Expertise in building robust and accessible web interfaces. 
Ability to profile and optimize web applications, with a deep understanding of developer tools of different browsers. 
Understanding of best practices for modern web application development, as well as continuous integration and deployment. 
Deep interest in the landscape of creative tools and ability to emphasize with creators.
