 The Computational Physics and Methods group at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is seeking qualified applicants in the areas of artificial intelligence / machine learning for Earth-system predictability and modeling. Candidates with experience in modeling and analyzing climate processes using innovative artificial intelligence / machine learning techniques are especially encouraged to apply. The successful candidate will contribute to development and application of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), the DOEâ€™s new Earth system model, to address science questions relevant to DOEâ€™s missions. Los Alamos National Laboratory is focused on the role of ocean and ice systems in high-latitude and global climate, marine biogeochemistry, land-river-ocean interactions, and the impacts of sea-level rise. The candidate will be expected to perform outstanding research in at least one of these areas, including using E3SM for fully coupled, global, variable-resolution simulations of the Earth system. 
 The successful candidate will:
 Work as an integral member of one or more multidisciplinary teams that study Earthâ€™s high-latitude climate and coastal systems.
 Advance understanding of predictability of the high-latitude and/or coastal Earth systems, by developing and applying innovative approaches to
 Improve the initialization of climate models;
 Analyze large data sets, including large ensembles of climate models; and/or
 Build predictive models based on observations and model simulations.
 Present progress to the team, project management and sponsors, and the scientific community through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.
