 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Research Engineer, AI for XR Facebook 623 reviews Redmond, WA Facebook 623 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. At Facebook Reality Labs (FRL), our goal is to explore, innovate, and design novel interfaces and hardware for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality experiences. We are driving research towards a vision of an always-on augmented reality device that can enable high-quality contextually relevant interactions across a range of complex, dynamic, real-world tasks in natural environments; to achieve this goal, our team draws on methods and knowledge from artificial intelligence, machine learning, optimal control, and cognitive science. We are specifically looking for a skilled and motivated AI researcher with expertise in deep learning, multimodal machine learning and data processing, or related fields to join our team. More broadly, the chosen candidate will work with a diverse and highly interdisciplinary team of researchers and engineers and will have access to cutting edge technology, resources, and testing facilities.In this position, you will work with domain experts in embodied artificial intelligence (AI), human-computer interaction, computer vision, cognitive and perceptual science, and sensing and tracking on problems that contribute to creating user-oriented contextual interactive systems. The position will involve building models that integrate multimodal data sources - including egocentric video, audio, and inertial motion unit (IMU) data, as well as graph-structured data and 3D reconstructions - to predict contextually relevant information that can enhance interactions with future augmented-reality devices.
 Implement highly scalable algorithms based on state-of-the-art machine learning and neural network methodologies 
Collaborate with Facebook Reality Labs Research Scientists to advance research that enables learning representations from egocentric video, audio, and inertial motion unit (IMU) data, as well as graph-structured data and 3D reconstructions 
Apply knowledge of relevant research domains along with expert coding skills to platform and framework development projects 
Adapt machine learning and neural network algorithms and architectures to best exploit modern parallel environments (e.g. distributed clusters, multicore SMP, and GPU) 
MS or PhD degree in the field of deep learning, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science, or related technical field 
Demonstrated track record in developing scalable, robust systems for training deep-learning models 
3+ years of experience in at least one deep-learning software library (e.g., PyTorch, Caffe2, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer). This experience should include formulation, training, and evaluation of new algorithms and writing reusable Python modules 
3+ years of experience developing end-to-end ML pipelines, including: dataset preprocessing, model development and evaluation, and software integration 
3+ years of experience working in a modern software development environment, including: unit testing, source control, and continuous integration 
Track record of peer-reviewed scientific publications, published open-source software, or other recognitions for scientific contributions (e.g., awards, grants) 
Familiarity with methods for rapidly adapting ML models such as few-shot learning, transfer learning, metric learning, metalearning, or continual learning 
Familiarity with state-of-the art deep-learning models for video, audio, and graph-structured data 
Familiarity with 3D simulation environments and engines 
Experience with deploying machine-learning/AI systems in real-time human-in-the-loop systems
