 About the job 
At Google weâ€™re committed to improving the lives of as many people as possible. One of the most important areas in which weâ€™re striving to do that is health.
 Today weâ€™re studying the use of artificial intelligence to assist in diagnosing cancer, predicting patient outcomes, preventing blindness, and much more. Weâ€™re exploring ways to improve patient care, including tools that are already being used by clinicians. And weâ€™re partnering with doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to help improve the care patients receive. 
 The primary objective of the Quality, Regulatory, Safety and Trust (QRST) Operations team is to support the stakeholders focused on quality management systems (QMS) by developing and maintaining compliant systems and labeling processes. 
 Google Health is building products and working with facilities across the globe. As such, the Product Labeling/Unique Device Identifier (UDI) Manager will build and refine the product labeling/UDI processes and capabilities while providing strategic guidance in the development and maintenance of the regulatory content of global labeling, symbols, and requirements. 
 In addition, aided by the greater organization, you will create scalable and repeatable processes, solutions, and tools that appear seamless to our users through automation and integration.
 Google Health has made major advances in healthcare research, such as detecting eye disease more quickly and accurately than experts, planning cancer radiotherapy treatment in seconds rather than hours, and working to detect patient deterioration before it happens with electronic records. 
 
Fundamental research is at the core of Google Health - the multidisciplinary team collaborates with partners to publish novel research in renowned scientific journals. They then work to apply this research into the medical field, whether through Streams, our clinical assistant app, or other clinical hardware and products developed in Google. Working alongside colleagues across Google, youâ€™ll help make this vision a reality. 
Responsibilities 
 Develop and implement templates and systems for product labeling and documentation required to support new product launches, global initiatives and country specific configurations. 
 Serve as a subject matter expert for European Union Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements including creation of a global UDI strategy and the implementation of that strategy following each countriesâ€™ requirements. 
 Interpret EUDAMED and GUDID regulations and establish data systems to stay compliant.
