 Description 
 About the Research 
 DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory is looking for exceptional scientists and engineers: undergraduate or graduate students, faculty, postdoctoral candidates, and senior researchers. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) is expected to play a key role in the ecosystem of future Army systems, from autonomous robotic systems to propulsion science to power and energy to advanced materials and manufacturing to soldier protection and ballistics to networks to human-agent teaming to quantum technologies to electronic warfare. Do you have expertise in AI/ML and want to do cutting-edge Army-specific research in the area? Do you have expertise in a different functional area and want to combine it with the latest AI/ML techniques for future Army capabilities? Are you searching for ways that your talent can contribute to research in Army applications? 
 The Midwest hub of the Army Research Laboratory, ARL Central, is launching an initiative to support short-term research opportunities (1 month to 1 year, potentially renewable) in areas of scientific research interest to the Army, including but not limited to research focus areas of the region such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science; propulsion, power, and energy; advanced materials and manufacturing; impact physics, energetic materials, and biomechanics; internet of battlefield things (IOBT); RF sensing and electronic warfare; to name a few. The initiative’s goals are to: 
 Advance the participant's scientific skills and knowledge in areas of critical national need Provide high impact research opportunities for outstanding scientists Promote the influx of new ideas and skills into ARL and the Army Enhance collaborative relationships with the broader academic/industrial research communities 
 As a part of this initiative, ARL Central seeks exceptional researchers, from student to postdoctoral researchers to faculty to senior researchers, to strengthen the collaborative relationships between our research partners in the Midwest and ARL, the Army, and the DOD. The emphasis of this initiative is to introduce applicants to mission-oriented science and technology programs in Army and DOD laboratories and centers. The applicants gain exposure to current national defense issues in science and technology, have opportunities to share and exchange innovative ideas and techniques, and make significant contributions to these programs. Participants are encouraged to publish and present research findings as part of a research team to enhance their own professional development. The interaction of ideas, skills, approaches, and technologies will be of mutual benefit to the fellow and to ARL/Army/DOD. 
 This initiative is also a unique opportunity to take full advantage of ARL’s strategic intra-extramural reach with a seamless collaboration among ARL laboratories, ARL scientists, regional campuses, and leading external scientists. For those researchers interested, a crash course into the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence will be offered to train in collaboration with scientists at ARL and at our partners.
