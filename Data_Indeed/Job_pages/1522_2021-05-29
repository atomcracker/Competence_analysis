We are credited with doubling email revenue, and increasing customer retention for more than 400 brands, including Express, Tommy Hilfiger, The North Face, Teleflora, and Bass Pro Shops.

 The Customer Success teamâ€™s Technical Services arm at Bluecore is committed to delivering quality products and services by holding each other accountable and always being open and honest. We use curiosity and creativity to drive ourselves and our customers towards higher levels of success while fostering a fun and collaborative environment. 
 
Bluecoreâ€™s Forward Deployed Engineering (FDE) unit is a software engineering team dedicated to helping Bluecore customers extract maximum value from the Bluecore Retail Data Platform. As an FDE, you will bring your technical know-how to the front lines, working directly with customers to draw meaningful intelligence from their websites and implement marketing solutions that map to the customerâ€™s vertical, audience behavior and product mix. 
 
As a Forward Deployed Engineer, your principal responsibilities will lie in (1) writing JavaScript integrations that live on client websites, (2) configuring and maintaining the intake and manipulation of client data across multiple channels including websites, SFTP clients, and Google Cloud Functions, (3) utilizing internal infrastructure and tooling to solve complex, often-unique, client-specific problems, and (4) interfacing with clients to help them understand and best utilize our array of products and services. Besides raw intellect and the ability to not take yourself too seriously, it is important to be detail-oriented in your work, as we work closely with a multitude of the industryâ€™s top online retailers, all of which have very stringent requirements around the look and feel of their strategic communications. 
 
You Are A Perfect Fit If You Love: 
 Interfacing with Clients: You are someone who loves chatting with clients and figuring out how to push the limits of Bluecoreâ€™s technology for them. You are equal parts engineer, consultant and subject matter expert with distinct gravitas. Our customers are often non-technical and are responsible for choosing and buying technically sophisticated products. The better we are at helping them understand and use our product, the more successful they will be and the more they will appreciate Bluecore. 
 Solving unique, complex problems: You are someone who can think critically, often on the fly, about nuanced technical problems to devise a scalable, maintainable solution. You enjoy the puzzle and the process of iterating and ideating before implementing a solve, and you are able to break complex problems into simple components for better analysis and digestion. 
 Metrics and Data: You are someone who finds yourself consumed by daily, weekly and monthly metrics and loves turning those into best practices. Seriously, you will be advising executive-level decision makers at industry-leading brands on best business practices. 
 Teaching Others: You are someone who actually believes that diversity in thought and skills makes for a better workplace and a better you.

Work as a liaison between clients, Customer Success, and the product development team to improve Bluecoreâ€™s product offering.
