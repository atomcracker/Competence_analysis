 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Psychiatrist - Telehealth Brightside Health 4 reviews Remote Remote Brightside Health 4 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. Depression Care Telehealth Psychiatrist, Board-Certified (Remote) 
The majority of people with depression arenâ€™t getting the care they need. Fewer than half seek care and a small fraction of those who do seek care receive treatment in line with best practices. 
Brightside (www.brightside.com) is a better approach to depression care, combining a consumer experience with evidence-based approaches, artificial intelligence, and a team of experienced doctors to deliver personalized treatment, right from your phone. Weâ€™re redefining depression care for the telemedicine age and are on a mission to be the largest and best provider of depression care in the US. 
Our Psychiatrists are using innovative, evidence-based approaches to expand access and improve outcomes, including: 
Telemedicine: Direct-to-consumer access via telemedicine, including asynchronous case review, video consultation, and e-prescribing lowers the barriers to accessing high-quality and affordable care. 
Measurement-Based Care (MBC): In line with best practice, we measure symptoms, adherence, and side effects weekly through the active treatment phase and automatically trigger treatment reviews if patients are not improving. We are redefining the physician: patient relationship, replacing encounter-based care with remote and proactive oversight enabled by technology. 
Machine learning-powered Clinical Decision Support: Contrary to conventional practice, data can help match patients to medications for better outcomes. Using machine learning and real-time data from patient monitoring, we are building a highly effective clinical decision support for antidepressant prescribing. 
Weâ€™re seeking-forward thinking Psychiatrists who understand the magnitude of the need and want to be part of the solution. Working with Brightside means the ability to practice with clinical autonomy and receive competitive compensation while working flexible hours from anywhere. Youâ€™ll use the latest tools, including custom-built practice management, EMR, and clinical decision support, all truly designed to be easy to use. 
Requirements: 
Be a licensed Psychiatrist in good standing with your state medical board (multiple active and unrestricted state licenses a plus!) 
Be board-certified 
Maintain all appropriate licensure to prescribe and dispense medications under applicable state and federal laws 
Have excellent grammar, attention to detail, and be efficient at writing medical information at a patient level
