 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Founding Designer Recurrency Remote Remote What we're looking for 
The space we're going after is about as archaic as it gets when it comes to design. We want our company to be differentiated by its attention to detail and design. We're looking for someone who is excited to own this effort, reset the standard for an entire industry, and lay the groundwork for Recurrency to be an innovator in enterprise software design.

How do you win and keep users' trust with this scary "artificial intelligence" thing? You will drive the execution required to answer these questions (and many more) as the point-person for UI and UX.

Implement and iterate on new features and enhancements in our dashboard 
Partner with our product & design team to design the user flows and features 
Work with the data team to better display and visualize insights for our users

Exceptional visual design chops, with an expert eye and appreciation for photography, typography, composition, layout, color, and a pixel-level attention to detail 
Ability to communicate creative concepts and articulate solutions to project stakeholders 
Proficiency in Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and Figma 
Excellence in everything you do 
Defaults to action; ships early and often 
Can-do attitude 
Desire to be a part of a feel-good, remote team 
Nice-to-haves, which we're sure you'll pick up along the way:
