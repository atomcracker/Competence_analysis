 Life as an Ezoic engineer: 
 Ezoic is an inaugural member of the Google Certified Publishing Partner Program. This means we work closely with Google to help websites optimize their ad revenue. We actually have won awards directly from Google for the artificial intelligence that we've built. Cool, right?!? 
 Ezoic is a technology-first company. Our CEO is a developer by trade, and our engineers are given all the tools needed to succeed. We empower our engineers to make a lot of their own decisions about both design and implementation, and encourage them to come up with new ideas to improve the application. We also aim to keep a good work-life balance, based on our philosophy that happy engineers are more productive. We want you to be working on something that you are passionate about and allow engineers to move around to keep things fresh. 
 Currently all engineers work remotely temporarily due to COVID-19. We have a brand new office in Carlsbad, CA, where we plan to return this year sometime when the world goes back to normal.  This means that we are only looking for engineers who are in or willing to relocate to the Carlsbad, CA area , but we can be flexible on timing based on the pandemic. Every engineer works at their own quad-monitor setup on a standing desk. We pride ourselves on getting stuff done, but when you need a break, Ezoic offers great perks, including unlimited vacation time, catered lunches, snacks, flexible hours, ping pong, video games, and pool. We also encourage VTO, and all employees are welcomed to take 20 hours of paid volunteer time off.
