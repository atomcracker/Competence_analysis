Legendary computer scientist Dr. Alan Kay said, 'The best way to predict the future is to invent it.' Through groundbreaking research and technology transfer activities, the NSA/CSS Computer and Analytic Sciences Research Group (R6) within NSA's Research Directorate is laying the groundwork for the Agency's future analytics and platforms. To build on the Group's successful track record of scientific and mission impact, we seek a highly motivated and technically creative leader to become R6's next Data Science Subject Matter Expert (SME).
NSA's Research Directorate is a large, technically and geographically distributed organization of researchers engaged in designing and implementing analytic algorithms (and their underlying architectures, as necessary) that can curate, harvest, and put into context seemingly unrelated pieces of information from an ever-growing and diverse set of sources. Scalable computing, the capability to turn information overload to our advantage, is a core area of computer science research for NSA Research, driven by the opportunities and challenges of new analytics on large data sets. NSA Research also maintains awareness of the architectures that can operate at a scale, speed, agility, and security levels to perform big-data analytics.
The Data Science Subject Matter Expert is responsible for providing subject matter expertise and world-class research in data science to include the following:
- Serve as a subject matter expert on data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, human machine teaming, statistics, visual analytics, human subject research, and adjacent fields.
- Develop novel techniques in data science and related areas to further the Agency's capabilities and understanding of computer and analytic science. Apply these techniques to the Agency's missions, particularly those related to Information and Intelligence Analysis and Cyber Operations.
- Provide significant data science subject matter leadership and mentoring.
- Ensure that NSA' Research Directorate prioritizes work that supports exploration, discovery, situational awareness, knowledge management, authoring & sharing, 'do it yourself' analytics, compliance, and semi-automated workflow generation & execution.
- Expand collaboration with other data science subject matter experts across the Research organization, the NSA enterprise, the Intelligence Community, Department of Defense, and academia.
- Design, conduct, direct, and implement research using advanced statistical machine learning and other data science techniques within a modern, flexible computational architecture.
- Provide subject matter expertise to short-and long-term technical efforts, and lead and direct these efforts.
- Provide subject matter expertise to support conducting quantitative and qualitative controlled experiments that provide evidence to the efficacy of developed techniques.
- Cultivate collaborative internal and external relationships with research leaders across the National Security Agency and in academia, industry, national labs, military service labs, other Intelligence Community organizations, and other United States Government entities.
- Work effectively with senior leaders, research staff and external customers at all levels and operate sensitively in politically-charged situations.
Areas of potential growth include but are not limited to: advanced research into artificial intelligence and machine learning, exploration of novel computer architectures (beyond cloud computing), and applications of social and behavioral sciences to the challenge of human and intelligent-machine teaming.
