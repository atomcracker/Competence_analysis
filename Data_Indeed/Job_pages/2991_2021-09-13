 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Post-Doctoral Associate University of Minnesota 1,264 reviews Minneapolis, MN Full-time University of Minnesota 1,264 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description Candidate must have a PhD degree in mechanical engineering, civil and environment engineering, aerospace engineering, applied mathematics, computational sciences, atmospheric sciences, physical oceanography, or a related field. Experience with computational and/or theoretical fluid mechanics research along with a strong publication record is required. Excellent communication skills in English are preferred.
 We are seeking post-doctoral researchers for positions in the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. The successful candidates will perform research in one or more of the following areas: 
 Water Waves : Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of nonlinear water wave dynamics, in the areas of wave-current interaction, interaction between internal and surface waves, air-sea interaction, nonlinear broadband wind-wave evolution, and coastal wave dynamics.
 Turbulent Boundary Layers and Atmospheric Flows : Fundamental fluid dynamics of high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layers, turbulent boundary layers at wavy surfaces, LES of atmospheric surface layer over complex terrains, coastal land-air-sea interaction, internal boundary layers, and LES data based parameterizations for mesoscale numerical weather prediction models. 
 Offshore Wind Energy : LES of wind/wave/windfarm interaction and floating wind turbine dynamics, and reduced-order modeling of offshore wind turbines and wind farms for their control and optimization. Note that the postdoc working on offshore wind energy is also expected to contribute to the research on marine atmospheric boundary layers.
 Multiphase Flows : High-fidelity simulations of gas-liquid two-phase flows and particle-laden turbulence. Applications of study include free-surface flows, interfacial mass and heat transfer, bubbly flows, breaking waves, sea spray droplets and aerosols, and the thermal and phase-change processes therein.
 Data-Driven Modeling and Scientific Computing :   Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and reduced-order modeling in fluid mechanics research with a focus on the above areas. Quantum computing for computational fluid dynamics.
 Responsibilities include conducting computational and theoretical fluid mechanics research, publishing scientific papers, and assisting supervisor in grant application, project reporting, and student supervision. The initial appointment is for the period of one year. The appointment is renewable up to six years in total, pending the availability of funds and satisfactory performance and progress review. 
The positions are located in the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL), an interdisciplinary fluid mechanics research center of the College of Science and Engineering. SAFL research is focused on fundamental fluid dynamics and the intersection of fluid mechanics with major societal challenges in energy, environment and health. The lab integrates cutting-edge experimental work at laboratory and field scales with advanced computational tools and theory to obtain innovative, science-based solutions to fluid-flow challenges. 
Research is led at SAFL by 17 full-time faculty members with appointments in Departments of Civil, Environmental, and Geo- Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Earth Sciences, and Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics in the College of Science and Engineering, as well as in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior in the College of Biological Sciences. SAFL personnel includes research and support staff members, postdoctoral associates, graduate students, as well as visiting researchers and undergraduate interns conducting research at SAFL. 
Applications must be submitted online. To be considered for this position, please click the Apply button and follow the instructions. You will be given the opportunity to complete an online application for the position and attach a cover letter, resume, and the names and contact information for three professional references. 
Additional documents may be attached after application by accessing your "My Job Applications" page and uploading documents in the "My Cover Letters and Attachments" section.
