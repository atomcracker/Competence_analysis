More specifically, youâ€™ll manage claims associated with home burglaries, car break-ins, missing diamond rings, and the like. Weâ€™re looking for inspired, driven individuals with tons of positive energy and a genuine passion for helping others.

Proficient in handling complex theft claims that often require SIU involvement 
Comfortable articulating yourself on the phone as well as via email 
Desire to work in a unique, dynamic, and fast-paced environment 
A surplus of empathy and patience, along with a positive approach to work and life
