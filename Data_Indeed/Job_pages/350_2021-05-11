Job Company Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description Are you excited about  Precision Medicine ? Would you like have an impact on patientsâ€™ lives and contribute to eliminate cancer as a cause of death? If so then join us! 
Weâ€™re investing like never before in our people, in growth, and in new diagnostic techniques and technologies. There are opportunities at every turn, with a variety and breadth that is uncommon to find and an industry-leading pipeline in oncology. Scientists at AstraZeneca are working every day to turn science fiction into science fact. Our ambition - to develop innovative, targeted medicines for every patient that needs them - and to match those treatments to patients most likely to benefit from them â€“ is now a reality. This approach, known as  Precision Medicine , is based on those individual characteristics that make some patients respond to treatment better than others. We use this knowledge to develop diagnostic tests that doctors can use to help prescribe the best treatment for each patient. Indeed, itâ€™s now become common practice for patients with cancer to be offered such diagnostic tests before their treatment plan is agreed. 
The AstraZeneca Companion Diagnostics Unit within the Precision Medicine and Biosamples function drives scientific leadership through the delivery of innovative companion diagnostics enabling our oncology ambition to transform the lives of patients living with cancer, and ultimately eliminate cancer as a cause of death. 
We do this by: 
Leading the development of diagnostics across AstraZenecaâ€™s early and late stage oncology portfolios through close collaborations with our external diagnostic partners. 
Leading the development and implementation of patient selection strategies to deliver companion diagnostics programs in support of our business priorities. 
Leading companion diagnostic regulatory interactions to secure companion diagnostic approvals in major markets 
Collaborate across AstraZeneca with colleagues in multiple Clinical functions plus commercial to help drive market uptake. 
Developing strategies for early cancer detection, near patient testing and implementing testing options for minimal residual disease and early treatment interventions. 
Utilising artificial intelligence diagnostic solutions and seeing software as a medical device. 
Developing specific disease area strategies (e.g. lung cancer, breast cancer or hematological malignancies) and new diagnostic modalities. 
Collaborating closely with fellow pharma companies on joint assets. 
Join this fantastic, collaborative team and be part of our success; we have already delivered over 50 innovative/impactful companion/complementary oncology diagnostic approvals across the major markets of the US, EU, Japan and China since 2014 and we need you to help us take the next steps in patient-centric diagnostic development.
