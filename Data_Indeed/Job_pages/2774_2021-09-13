 Every day, enterprises around the world focus on how to help their employees work simpler and smarter. And while enterprises are as diverse as the people in them, ranging from global manufacturing concerns, to healthcare companies taking care of the elderly, to renowned universities, and even one of the fastest growing cities in the world, they all share many core needs. They need to take care of their employees and their families by putting them in control of their benefits. They need to connect employees with their customers so they in turn can thrive. They need to thoughtfully manage their valuable resources. They need to work efficiently with the vendors they depend on. And so much more.
 Helping everyone work simpler and smarter means letting enterprises focus on what makes each of them special. They focus on what theyâ€™re best at, and in turn, let Oracle do the rest. The scope of our opportunity is enormous.
 At Oracle, weâ€™re committed to creating a state-of-the-art consumer-grade enterprise experience that connects, empowers, and delights our users, and is the factor that distinguishes our software from the competition.
 Yes. Weâ€™re absolutely serious. And weâ€™d love to have your help.
 We need thoughtful, talented, multi-faceted user experience designers who love empowering technology users with high quality interaction, visual, and motion design to bring their creative ideas and their hard work to join our team.
 Hereâ€™s the kind of person weâ€™re looking for.
 You thrive on working well with others.  You make the people around you better. You love to collaborate with designers, user researchers, engineers, product managers, executives, and inspire them to do their best.
 Youâ€™re a full stack user experience designer.  You look at interaction design, visual design and aesthetics, typography, motion, 3D, human factors, and more as tools in the UX designerâ€™s toolkit. You may have strengths in some of these areas, and want to learn more in others, but you know how to talk about each and work with your colleagues to combine them all into an experience that delights.
 You get stuff done.
 Youâ€™re a fantastic storyteller.  You know that our products tell our customers a story through the user experience. You wonâ€™t rest until that story is a compelling one.
 You love rules and you know when to break them.  You think systemically because you know that creating a coherent experience requires it. But you know when the system needs to expand to accommodate a userâ€™s varied conceptual model. And you know when to do something completely unique to create an arresting and product-defining moment that makes users ooh and aah.
 You donâ€™t already know everything, and you love to learn.  Youâ€™re inspired by helping users solve their problems. You love finding out youâ€™re wrong. You consume large amounts of quantitative and qualitative data to constantly refine your assumptions.
 And finally, you want to be part of creating dramatic and impactful change at a company that is committed to becoming a light unto others when it comes to user experience design.
 You might have learned your craft via formal training or via on-the-job training. For most candidates, itâ€™s a combination of both. As long as youâ€™ve got experience and passion doing this work at the highest level, weâ€™d love to talk to you and see a portfolio of the work youâ€™re most proud of.
 Oracleâ€™s Human-Artificial Intelligence User Experience Team  is focused on designing human-AI interactions to make proactive and personalized products that improve peopleâ€™s lives and help them achieve their goals. A tall order? Yes, and one that is vitally important to create the conditions for people and computers to work together to be more effective. We are as interested in leveraging new technology as we are in ensuring that the technology is robust, transparent, fair, ethical, and lawful. And, given the arena of possibilities and challenges presented by AI/ML, we carefully examine our enterprise use cases to get the right balance of representation, communication, and intervention in our solutions. We design the products and tools that are at the core of Oracleâ€™s AI/ML platform, as well as the AI/ML-enabled components and patterns to infuse intelligence into the Redwood Design System. To ensure these capabilities are maximized across Oracle applications, we establish Human-AI Interaction Principles and Guidelines and work with product designers as they incorporate AI/ML into their UX designs.
 What will you do as a designer on Oracleâ€™s Human-Artificial Intelligence User Experience Team?
 Partner with Adaptive Intelligence product managers and developers to identify use cases where AI/ML can increase efficiency and help people make better informed decisions.
 Stay abreast of developments in AL/ML and human-AI interaction design to extend and evolve our HAII Principles and Guidelines. Develop training materials to help others learn and use the principles and guidelines.
 Understand user needs, problems, and goals across diverse use cases, and articulate guiding principles to ground and inspire your ideation and prototyping as you explore various design solutions.
 Create wireframes, flows, and UI mocks for product and tool designs.
 Create interaction specifications using language, diagrams, and prototypes to describe component usage, anatomy, behavior, and configuration with clarity and detail.
 Partner closely with engineering teams from design to hand off, and ensure products, tools, and components are implemented to specification.
 Partner closely with researchers and data scientists to gain insight to drive and improve designs.
 If youâ€™re interested, please get in touch. Weâ€™d love to hear from you.
