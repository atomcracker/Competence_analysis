 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Associate, Data Scientist KPMG 6,857 reviews Los Angeles, CA 90071 KPMG 6,857 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. Job Company Historically, the travel requirement for this position has ranged from 80-100%.

At some point in the future and with the safety of people as the critical factor, the travel requirement will likely increase, possibly to previous levels, but KPMG is committed to balancing client requirements with new delivery capabilities.
