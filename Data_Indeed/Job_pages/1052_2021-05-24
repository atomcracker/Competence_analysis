 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Research Scientist, Computer Vision Facebook 622 reviews Redmond, WA Facebook 622 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. At Facebook Reality Labs Research, our goal is to explore, innovate, and design novel interfaces and hardware for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality experiences. We are driving research towards a vision of an always-on augmented reality device that can enable high-quality contextually relevant interactions across a range of complex, dynamic, real-world tasks in natural environments; to achieve this goal, our team draws on methods and knowledge from artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and humanâ€“computer interaction. We are specifically looking for a skilled and motivated computer-vision researcher with expertise in 3D computer vision and perception, geometric computer vision, object recognition, representation learning, or related fields to join our team. More broadly, the chosen candidate will work with a diverse and highly interdisciplinary team of researchers and engineers and will have access to cutting edge technology, resources, and testing facilities.In this position, you will work with an interdisciplinary team of domain experts in embodied artificial intelligence (AI), humanâ€“computer interaction, computer vision, cognitive and perceptual science, and sensing and tracking on problems that contribute to creating user-oriented contextual interactive systems. The position will involve building models that integrate multimodal data sourcesâ€”including dense 3D reconstructions, egocentric video, audio, gaze, and other signals from wrist-wearable inputsâ€”to predict contextually relevant information that will enhance interactions with future augmented-reality devices. These models will leverage large-scale real-world data sets and the scale of Facebook machine-learning infrastructure, and will be deployed into AR/VR prototypes to uncover research questions on the path to the next era of human-centered computing. 
Develop and execute a cutting-edge research program with interdisciplinary collaborators aimed at developing contextual models and representations from multimodal data sources, including 3D reconstructions 
Develop code for deployment in research prototypes 
Work collaboratively with other research scientists to develop novel solutions and models in service of contextualized AI for augmented reality 
Mentor MS/PhD interns and postdocs and collaborate with external academic groups to advance our research goals 
PhD degree in computer science, computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or related technical field 
Demonstrated track record in defining and leading research in advanced 3D computer vision and deep learning, including tracking, object understanding, scene reconstruction, representation learning, or related areas 
5+ years of experience in at least one deep-learning software library (e.g., PyTorch, Caffe2, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer). This experience should include formulation, training, and evaluation of new algorithms and writing reusable Python modules 
5+ years of experience developing end-to-end CV/ML pipelines in at least three of the following areas: dataset preprocessing, model development and evaluation, software integration, and real-time deployment in embedded systems 
5+ years of experience working in a modern software development environment, including: unit testing, source control, and continuous integration 
Understanding of the full machine vision pipeline from sensors to high-level algorithms 
Experience in geometric computer vision, including tracking, 3D reconstruction, localization, object detection, and scene understanding 
Experience leading a team of researchers toward executing on a complex technical goal in a cross-functional setting 
Proven track record of achieving significant results as demonstrated by grants, fellowships, patents, as well as first-authored publications at leading workshops or conferences such as CVPR, NeurIPS, ECCV/ICCV, ICCP, ICML, 3DV, BMVC, or SIGGRAPH 
Familiarity with ideas in transfer learning, few-shot learning, and multimodal machine learning
