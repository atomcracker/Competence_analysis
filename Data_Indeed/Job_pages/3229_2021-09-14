 Life as an Ezoic engineer: 
Our technology reaches tens of millions of people every month and adoption is growingly quickly. Ezoic is a technology-first company. Our CEO is a developer by trade, and our engineers are given all the tools needed to succeed. We empower our engineers to make a lot of their own decisions about both design and implementation, and encourage them to come up with new ideas to improve the application.

We want you to be working on something that you are passionate about and allow engineers to move around to keep things fresh.
 
 
We have a new office in Carlsbad, CA, which is currently open to employees who have been fully vaccinated and wish to work in the office. We want to get back to in-person work this fall, but plan to allow engineers to work from home regularly if they can be more productive there.  This means we are only looking for engineers who are in or willing to relocate to the Carlsbad, CA  area, but we will be flexible on timing based on how the pandemic goes. Every engineer works at their own quad-monitor setup on a standing desk. We pride ourselves on getting stuff done, but when you need a break, Ezoic offers great perks, including unlimited vacation time, catered lunches, snacks, flexible hours, ping pong, video games, and pool. We also encourage VTO, and all employees are welcomed to take 20 hours of paid volunteer time off.
