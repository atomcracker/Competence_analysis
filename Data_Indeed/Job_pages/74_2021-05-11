 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Vice President of Construction - Houston Corporate Venterra Realty 63 reviews Houston, TX 77070 Venterra Realty 63 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description Venterra Realty is a privately held corporate success story by any measure. We are a technology company, an investment management company, and a commercial real estate company. Venterra has just under $4 billion AUM; revenue of $350+ million. We own and operate over 65 multi-unit residential communities, representing more than 18,000 units in the highest growth cities in the Southern United States. Over the past 20 years, and through 3 economic cycles, we have achieved a 10% annual growth rate. 
Investors have enjoyed some of the best risk-adjusted returns available in the investment universe, not just the real estate sector. Average annual returns have been 18%+ over a 20-year period. These returns have been earned using low leverage. Financial/operating performance of the firmâ€™s investments has exceeded the average performance of the top U.S. public REITs by almost 50% over the past 12 years. Significant capital is available to fund further growth with a long waiting list of prospective investors. Residents at Venterra properties rate their living experience in the top 5% nationally of all apartment communities. Last year, GlassDoor.com rated Venterra one of the 50 best places to work in America (out of 600,000+ firms) and FORTUNE Magazine (top 100) rated Venterra as one of the best workplaces in the U.S. for companies with fewer than 1000 employees. 
Our plans for growth are ambitious and diversified while retaining our Real Estate focus. We foresee significant growth in our core value add product through geographic expansion into several, already qualified US cities, as well as through ground-up development of Multifamily communities. Within the coming year, we will have started two ground-up multi-residential development projects (each 300+ units and $50M+ in capital). We are in the early stages of exploring new products, such as affordable housing and single-family rental. And to ensure that we capitalize on emerging property technologies, we are an LP in one of the largest private equity Property Technology (Proptech) venture capital firms in our sector. 
Technology is in the DNA of its founders, and they are the leaders of Venterra today. The Chair holds a Masterâ€™s Degree in Artificial Intelligence. Earlier in their careers, the Chair and the CEO jointly led the growth and sale of a highly successful software technology business focused on transportation logistics optimization. They then applied their business and technology acumen to the real estate industry and created Venterra. Though the owners were independently wealthy before turning 40, they have spent the past 20 years founding and growing this very successful business. 
This technology background has resulted in Venterra being one of the few companies in the industry with our own in-house property management system and 50-person Technology Group allowing us to control our technology destiny, which is increasingly important if we want to compete at the highest levels. Technology empowers Venterraâ€™s Operations team to be a leader and innovator of customer experience. Using technology extensively, we were able to create a near touchless interface with residents during the crisis. This is one of the many technology-driven innovations that lead to Venterra significantly outperforming the overall U.S. multi-family industry during the COVID-19 Crisis. 
Venterra is an intriguing employer offering exposure to three sectorsâ€”technology, investment management, and real estate. We have several paths charted for growth and are well-capitalized. The Venterra core values result in a culture that embraces creative thinking and execution talent.
