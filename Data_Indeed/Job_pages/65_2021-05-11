 A seismic shift is underway in the mobility and motion world where hardware, software and services are all merging in unprecedented ways. Coupled with a move towards Artificial Intelligence and machine learning allows us to build technology platforms unimaginable just a couple of years ago. 
 We believe, as a result, vehicles and other forms of mobility (Droneâ€™s, etc.) are going to start to do things themselves, and that ownership will shift from the individual to the corporation, resulting in overall mobility becoming experience driven. Most importantly, these seismic shifts are creating massive operational complexities that can only be solved with highly sophisticated Artificial Intelligence software, married with a highly integrated understanding of physics (motion).
