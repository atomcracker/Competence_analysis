 At TAUS we have a dedicated data services platform named Human Language Project (HLP), where we provide language data enhancement work (translation, evaluation, labeling, etc.) to build language data sets primarily in low-resource languages. 
 This type of data is mainly meant for AI/ML purposes like Machine Translation engines training, which are in high demand for the less digitally represented languages. Though we normally work with non-professional workers, we aim at cooperating with highly educated multilingual speakers, targeting for example (language) university students. All work is performed on our online platform, where workers can claim and perform the necessary work at their own pace.
