Intuit believes in the power of the individual. The power to do more. To make more. To be more. 
We believe in the people who do things – the hat jugglers, the to-do list gurus, those who love getting it done faster, better, and more efficiently than ever before. Whether that's balancing the household budget, running a business, or paying taxes. 
We believe in these people because we are these people. We thrive on action – and results. And by making things simpler, we all get more out of doing what we love. We're innovators and have been at it for more than three decades. And we don't stand still. 
As the world evolves, so do we – inventing new solutions to solve important problems, perfecting those solutions, and delighting our customers. In short: We’re on a mission to power prosperity around the world. 
We started small in 1983 with Quicken personal finance software, simplifying a common household dilemma: balancing the family checkbook. Today, Intuit is a leading provider of fintech solutions for consumers, SMBs, and the self-employed. You probably know us by our flagship products, TurboTax, QuickBooks, Mint, and Credit Karma, which serve over 90 million consumers and seven million small businesses and self-employed across North America, Europe, Australia, and Brazil. 
Just as we transformed before, from DOS to the web, and to the cloud and mobile, we are evolving again to deliver personalized experiences on a trusted, open platform that helps create indispensable connections. 
Supporting our mission, our strategy is to become an AI-driven expert platform and deliver three core benefits to our customers: 
More money - helping put more money in the pockets of our customers 
No Work - eliminating work and drudgery so they can focus on what matters to them 
Complete Confidence - ensuring that they have complete confidence in every financial decision they make through our do-it-yourself or live expert support platforms 
As the way we live and work evolves, we adapt our strategy to meet and lead these changes. We are committed to creating new and easier ways for consumers and businesses to tackle life's financial chores, giving them more time to live their lives and run their businesses. As our businesses and product lines grow beyond finance and accounting into new areas, we will build on our heritage of innovation. That's not just our history. It's our future.
