 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Brand Designer IRL United States Remote Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description Company Overview 
 IRL (http://www.irl.com/) is the leading group messaging social network that brings people together through events and shared experiences. With its wide range of in-app offerings, including personalized event suggestions using artificial intelligence, calendar integrations, messenger and private group pages, IRL deepens everyone's ability to connect through organic community-building and engaging social interaction. 
 Based on humans' natural group orientation and essential need to communicate, especially in the post-COVID era, IRL is building the future of interaction by translating these inherent needs onto one platform and encouraging users to do more together. 
 IRL has raised $170 million dollars in their Series C round led by SoftBank, with the promise that we will redefine the messaging category. This is a perfect opportunity to come in fairly early and make an impact. The user base has grown significantly in the last year, and we aim to continue that trajectory while expanding the team. 
IRL has consistently been featured in the App Store under Apps We Love and has grown to >20m users. We've achieved great growth results and are looking to grow the team by 3x in the next 12 months.
