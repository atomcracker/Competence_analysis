 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Operations Fathom Radiant Boulder, CO Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description About us 
Fathom Radiant is building computer hardware to train neural networks at the human brain-scale and beyond. By combining the complementary strengths of optics and electronics, we have developed a revolutionary interconnect fabric that enables a flexible machine with the network capacity of a supercomputer and unprecedented scalability. 
 
 Our founding team has previously founded startups with more than $500 million in exits. We are well-funded from investors including Khosla Ventures, Jeff Bezos, and many others. 
Our mission 
Fathom was founded using first-principles thinking to build hardware that can enable artificial general intelligence. We don't consider beneficial advancement inevitable and believe that we can make the difference in how and when safe machine intelligence is developed. 
As a public benefit corporation, we are bound by our charter to help mitigate the risks that such technology creates and ensure that its benefits are shared by all. To pursue these goals we have chosen to establish an independent ethics board, collaborate with other groups focused on beneficial AI, and investigate policy mechanisms for the differential advancement of AI alignment research. 
Our values 
In our people, we above all value kindness, a scout mindset, a focus on improvement, and prioritising to get the right things done. 
 
 We aim to build one of the most potentially transformative technologies in the world, with massive social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we are actively striving to have a range of diverse perspectives on our team. 
 
 Help us build the future of beneficial AI. 
 
 This role 
Very powerful computing hardware is strategically relevant to AGI research, affecting, when, how, and where AGI is developed. We plan to use this strategic advantage to advance alignment research, help prevent misuse, and aid coordination between value-aligned actors. In this role, you can help magnify the productivity and focus of our team, helping Fathom stay mission-focused and driven to have a large positive effect on the future of machine intelligence. We're making sure that the advanced computing hardware weâ€™re building is a good thing for the world, by forming a capable safety board, implementing a windfall clause, and prioritizing strategies for differentially advancing safety research, among other initiatives. 
Our ideal candidate will care deeply about our mission. We're a small company now so you'd be joining just before we expand 6x in the next 9 months. We're looking for people with a range of skills within strategy, productivity, legal, HR, finance, facilities, but we don't require experience across every single one of these. We're especially excited about people who are willing to learn new things and jump in wherever help is needed, with plenty of support.
