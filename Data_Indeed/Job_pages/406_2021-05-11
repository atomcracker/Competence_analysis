Work remote, part time 
Work on the go, at your convenience 
Flexible scheduling 
Hours available are between 7am - 10pm 
Shifts available Monday - Friday AND Saturday, Sunday 
 
Work part time, on the go, at your convenience. You will work alongside other trainers, and work varying shifts per week. 
 
Enjoy complete flexibility, so long as you have access to the internet (desktop, is preferred, but mobile work from a phone is acceptable after adequate training). 
 
Work tasks include labeling data in a particular way to allow for accurate and timely messages between the Structurely product and consumers looking to buy, sell or rent real estate. 
 
Data labeling is done through a proprietary application developed by Structurely, for which training will be provided. 
 
THE CHALLENGE 
 
Real estate agents, and all salespeople, need new leads to do business. However, once the salesperson gets a lead, 50% of the time that lead isn't followed up with. Ouch. There are over 20,000,000 leads created in real estate  alone,  every year. 
 
Structurely exists to help real estate agents and salespeople respond to those leads at scale by using an artificial intelligence (AI) "assistant." The problem is, this assistant isn't all-knowing...yet.
 In this role, you will guide Structurely into the new frontier of AI. You'll be responsible for managing data sent to our AI assistant by appropriately tagging, labeling and monitoring real estate sales related inquiries. 
 
 THE OPPORTUNITY 
 
You have the opportunity to optimize the way we manage mission-critical data through technology, best practice experience, and process improvements so we can continue to scale while continuing to improve the company's profitability. 
 
This role allows Structurely to optimize our machine learning and AI models using the data you're responsible for. You will work closely with product and machine learning engineers to understand the data at a deep level, where we might be falling short, and recommendations to make improvements. 
 
You will work part time, at your convenience to utilize internal products and tools at Structurely to label, annotate and review real estate related messages from consumers. 
 
THE TEAM 
 
The AI Data Training Team at Structurely is responsible for the utmost quality-assured data. Alongside the AI Engineering Team at Structurely, the AI Data Training Team works in accordance with the procedures and specifications set out by the product and development roadmap.
