 About the job 
Like Google's own ambitions, the work of a Software Engineer (SWE) goes way beyond just Search. SWE Managers have not only the technical expertise to take on and provide technical leadership to major projects, but also manage a team of engineers. You not only optimize your own code but make sure engineers are able to optimize theirs. As a SWE Manager you manage your project goals, contribute to product strategy and help develop your team. SWE teams work all across the company, in areas such as information retrieval, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security, data compression, user interface design; the list goes on and is growing every day. Operating with scale and speed, our exceptional software engineers are just getting started - and as a manager, you guide the way. 
 In delivering on its mission, the Customer Solutions Engineering (CSE) team ensures technology continuity at the customer edge of Google Global Networking (GGN). This includes owning the entire lifecycle of new products and technologies being introduced into the network - conceptualizing, prototyping, developing, executing the pilot, rolling out to the network, making it generally available, supporting the network/design in its deployed state, and deprecating it. The team holds itself accountable for the holistic health of the customer facing edge network and ensuring the edge meets its promised Service Level Objective (SLOs). 
Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google's product portfolio possible. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.
