 Who We Are 
 The Institute for Student-AI Teaming founded by National Science Foundation (NSF), will develop, deploy, and study AI Partners that interact naturally with students and teachers through speech, gesture, gaze, and facial expression in real-world classrooms and remote learning settings. The AI partners will be designed in close collaboration with educators with the aim of supporting students to develop STEM competencies, disciplinary practices, and 21st century skills. The long-term impact on the Institute is to help realize the grand challenge of ‚ÄúEducation for All.‚Äù The Institute will accomplish this goal by leading the nation towards a future where all students‚Äîespecially those whose identities are underrepresented in STEM‚Äîroutinely participate in rich and rewarding AI-enabled collaborative learning experiences that scale, resulting in deeper student engagement and persistence in STEM, more inclusive classroom cultures, and significant improvements in learning outcomes. 
The Institute for Student-AI Teaming is hosted and supported by the Institute of Cognitive Science (ICS) at CU-Boulder. Founded in 1968, the mission of ICS is to understand and enhance human cognition, learning, and development through the creation of interdisciplinary partnerships. ICS fosters rich scientific interchange across researchers from a broad range of disciplines, including Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics, Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Philosophy, and Education.
