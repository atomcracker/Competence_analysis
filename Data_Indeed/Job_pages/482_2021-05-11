Join one of the fastest growing companies in America. 
 
US Cloud added to the  Inc 5000 List  ‚Äì ranking of private companies with the most proven track records. 
Our 100% USA-based, never-outsourced Microsoft Premier Support engineers are the engine that drives US Cloud. And if you want to be recognized and work with the best of the best, our Premier Support team is for you. Engineering at US Cloud isn‚Äôt a cost center, it‚Äôs a profit center. New engineers coming over from the enterprise or MSP‚Äôs are surprised at how different it feels to be the lifeblood of a company vs. an ancillary support service. Simply put, our engineers are corporate IT‚Äôs first-responders and we give them the credit and respect they deserve each time they save the day for one of our clients. 
 
 
US Cloud engineers get the most challenging questions from savvy clients like Under Armour, NetApp, Garmin, 24-Hour Fitness, AmeriGas, L.L. Bean, Siemens, and the US Department of State, to name just a few - all of them depending on us to underpin their Microsoft environments and keep them running. When they can‚Äôt fix it, they call US Cloud. 
 
 
ABOUT US CLOUD 
 
Our simple mission is to liberate businesses shackled to mediocre, overpriced, and monopolistic Microsoft Support. As a Microsoft Service Provider for 20+ years, Fpweb.net and CyberVault, now US Cloud, has supported 1,000‚Äôs of Microsoft clients in over 80 countries. 
 
 
With recent and dramatic changes in Microsoft‚Äôs strategy, the demand for high-quality, cost-effective 3rd-party product support has erupted. Simply put, we need more hands-on deck to help manage our current growth and to make the most of this intensifying trend. 
 
 
We replace MSFT Premier/Unified to save enterprises 30-50% on support costs. We provide ultra-responsive, fanatical support from domestic US teams while freeing up funds to invest in innovation, create competitive advantage and drive growth. 
 
 
US Cloud is the only Gartner-recognized Microsoft Support alternative in the world. 
 
 
WHY JOIN US CLOUD? 
 
Snacks, coffee, and gym memberships are great, but what typically gets our engineers excited is learning new things. By design we team folks across technologies, so they cross-pollinate and share information daily ‚Äì no product silos here. We move engineers in and out of team pods so they don‚Äôt get stale. Our engineers knowledge-share via catered lunches and training seminars on hot technologies like Cloud, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. 
 
 
Plus, opportunities to progress in your career go hand-in-hand with rapidly growing companies. Our team members have more opportunities to shift concentrations, tackle new technologies, or step into leadership roles as our business continues to expand.
