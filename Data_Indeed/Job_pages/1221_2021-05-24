 What You'll Do: 
Work with business teams to draft, negotiate, and execute commercial agreements (think marketing service agreements, affiliate relationships, enterprise IT deals, and SaaS arrangements, etc.)
 
Be a trusted legal advisor as part of the business teams' efforts to establish, evaluate, and expand new business initiatives, product development, and integrated marketing campaigns
 
Provide day-to-day legal perspective and business-oriented guidance - help spot legal issues and recommend practical solutions that appropriately balance risk management within business operations
 
Stay current on digital advertising and marketing law trends, industry issues, and novel approaches to legal services, and maintain a working understanding of digital technologies (you don't need to be an expert, but if we say "cookies," your first instinct shouldn't be "chocolate chip or oatmeal?")
 
Help increase effectiveness, and efficiency, of legal-business support through development of enterprise forms, contract playbooks, and legal compliance tools
 
 What We're Looking For: 
Juris Doctor degree from an ABA-accredited U.S. law school, and member of the bar of a U.S. jurisdiction
 
3+ years of solid, consistent experience working with business teams in connection with corporate legal matters (ideally all with one employer)
 
Core competencies in contract review, drafting, and negotiation
 
If you have industry-specific experience or interest, let us know! Acronyms and buzzwords that come up across our legal team include things like the FTC, TCPA, HIPAA, FCRA, CCPA/GDPR, IAB, SEO, CRM, paid search, programmatic, ad-tech/mar-tech
 
Red Ventures is a flat organization where everyone contributes â€“ being ready and willing to roll up your sleeves on tasks big and small, and to seek out answers and resources when needed, will serve you well here
 
Ability to operate in a dynamic environment and navigate amid uncertainty with a can-do, problem-solving attitude is a must! We are not the legal team of "no" or Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ - instead we are equal parts risk identifiers and problem solvers. And if you can liven up your legal advice with some humor, that is a plus (and always encouraged)
