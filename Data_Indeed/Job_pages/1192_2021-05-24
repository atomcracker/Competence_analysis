 Position Summary
 
The next generation of drug discovery is at the convergence of human genetics and artificial intelligence.
 The cost to sequence a human genome is rapidly decreasing and will approach $100 in the coming years. This is driving the creation of multiomic data sets, population sequencing of multi-million human cohorts, gene expression profiles of millions of cells from a single sample, experiments to characterize the functional consequences of all possible variants in a gene, surveys of the complete human immune repertoireâ€¦ and this is just the beginning. 
 
To derive value and insights from these unprecedented data sets, genomics has become an information science where the application of artificial intelligence is enabling breakthroughs in our understanding of disease mechanisms. These insights are now being translated into candidate drug targets. 
 
Towards this end, Illumina is pioneering the application of artificial intelligence to large combined clinical-multiomic data sets. We are now surpassing the performance of earlier heuristic or biologically modeled approaches. For example, PrimateAI and SpliceAI predict variant pathogenicity and splice site function with higher accuracy than previous approaches, and even larger improvements are currently in development to predict the effects of both coding and noncoding variation across diverse biological functions. These new tools will support Illuminaâ€™s development of automated AI-based genome interpretation and a technology platform for identifying potential drug targets. 
 
We are looking for an extraordinary leader to drive our initiative to create improved platforms for drug discovery. This executive will be responsible for all aspects of the newly formed business area within the Research and Technology Development organization, reporting to the Chief Technology Officer. The organization will oversee Illuminaâ€™s target discovery platform development, leveraging the platform to deliver technology and potential drug targets into pharma partnersâ€™ drug development pipelines. The candidate will be responsible for architecting and scaling the organizational structure, recruiting top minds across product strategy, data science & machine learning, computational biology, and
 
therapeutic areas. This leader will collaborate with Product Development and our Business Units to envision and create a new business based on innovations across genomics technology, machine learning, high-throughput biology, and
 
disease modeling.
