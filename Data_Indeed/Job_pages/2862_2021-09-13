 Human and AI Systems Research (HAR) Lab in Intel Labs focuses on multi-disciplinary research spanning ethnography, design, HCI and AI to create Human/AI collaborative systems that can amplify human potential and create sustainable and transparent AI solutions. We utilize multi-modal signals (e.g. vision, audio, speech, language , physiology) and AI to infer and predict human state and actions and enable contextual learning for physically situated recognition, dialog and interactions. We conduct fundamental and applied research in the context of vertical domains including manufacturing, education, enterprise, and assistive computing. 
Intel Labs is an industry-leading research organization, responsible for driving Intel's technology pipeline, product innovations, and creating new opportunities. The mission of Intel Labs is to deliver breakthrough technologies to fuel Intel's growth. This includes identifying and exploring compelling new technologies and high risk opportunities ahead of business unit investment and demonstrating first-to-market technologies and innovative new usages for computing technology. Intel Labs engages the leading thinkers in academia and industry in addition to partnering closely with Intel business units. 
HAR is looking for a FT Researcher with experience at the intersection of machine learning and human computer interaction domain who can lead and/or collaborate on research projects being conducted in one or more of HAR's interdisciplinary focus areas.
 As a FT Researcher you will be working on developing interactive learning systems with one or more of modalities such as language, vision, speech or physiology. Current projects span across vertical domains like smart education, enterprise collaboration or manufacturing augmentation.
 In this position you will have the opportunity to conduct independent research on building multimodal learning systems and applications. Typical work would span across running data collection and annotation experiments via crowdsourcing, developing, optimizing and deploying deep learning models with limited data, and developing and applying model interpretation methods to support decision making. You will be researching fundamental concepts and methods for mixed-initiative learning systems, building and evaluating systems and proofs-of-concept that will allow for the deployment of scalable approaches in real settings. This research will enable internal technology transfers and publication of findings in both internal and external venues. 
The successful candidate should exhibit the following behavioral traits: 
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. 
What we offer: 
We give you opportunities to transform technology and create a better future, by delivering products that touch the lives of every person on earth.
