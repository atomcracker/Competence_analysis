Chair of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 
 University of Florida College of Medicine
 The University of Florida College of Medicine invites applications and nominations for the position of Department Chair of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 
The University of Florida (UF) is a top-tier research university with $900 million of annual research funding and an outstanding record of training undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. The UF College of Medicine is the largest of six colleges at the UF Academic Health Center, which is located on the main campus in Gainesville, FL. UF is ranked #6 and the UF College of Medicine is ranked #15 in the latest U.S. News and World Report rankings for public universities. 
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) is a research-intensive department and our areas of research strength fall into three main areas. These include (1) Structural Biochemistry (virus structure and cryo-EM, NMR spectroscopy, and protein x-ray crystallography) (2) Metabolism (metabolism and disease, metabolomics, and metabolic flux analysis), and (3) Molecular Biology (RNA structure and function, epigenetics, gene regulation, DNA repair and replication). The campus-wide UF Artificial Intelligence Initiative is a new area under development in the Department. Our research programs will continue to take advantage of existing resources that include established centers, institutes and core facilities on the UF campus. HiPerGator 3.0 and HiPerGator AI, the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, enable scalable artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance data analytics. BMB houses the Center for Structural Biology and the Center for Epigenetics. The Advanced Magnetic Resonance and Imaging (AMRIS) Facility at the McKnight Brain Institute is a state-of-the-art user facility for high-resolution solution NMR, solid-state NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization NMR, preclinical MRI/S, and human MRI/S and is part of the NSF-funded National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL). Additional support for our research programs is provided by the UF Health Cancer Center UF Genetics Institute, the Cryo-Electron Microscopy core in the UF Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, and the Center for Integrative Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease. Taken together, these facilities provide unique state-of-the-art instrumentation and technical expertise to support our research programs and help recruit new research faculty needing these resources. 
Our educational activities serve students at the undergraduate, professional, and graduate levels. The Department provides students with learning opportunities in the classroom and in our research laboratories. We play a major role in the graduate curricula that serves students in the Biomedical Sciences Ph.D. program, the Genetics and Genomics Ph.D. program, and the BMB Master‚Äôs Degree program. We are actively involved in the Medical Education (M.D.) curriculum and teach in three courses for first-year medical students. We participate in the UF Medical Honors Program and teach first-year dental students. The department also teaches an undergraduate course in biochemistry and molecular biology that is required for many undergraduate majors and is a prerequisite for professional and graduate programs. 
JOB QUALIFICATIONS
