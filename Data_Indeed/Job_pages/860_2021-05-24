SUMMARY / ABOUT THE JOB 
As a software engineer on the flight autonomy team, you will develop autonomous behaviors for unmanned aerial vehicles, integrating with on-board payload, sensor, and flight control systems. Our aircraft operate in remote environments with intermittent user input, driving the need for reliable interfaces for command and control and reduced cognitive load on the user. We build reliable systems for airspace management (control areas, landing zones, etc), terrain avoidance, precision landing, payload control, and perception-driven control algorithms. 
We develop state machines with traceable behavior to capture the correct modes of operation, fielding, and troubleshooting every day at our test site to harden critical logic. Our algorithms for control and guidance must be optimized for performance and latency on embedded systems while maintaining accuracy and precision. Our engineers develop robust ways to manage autonomous flight in complex environments while providing effective tools for the user to provide aircraft and payload commands.
