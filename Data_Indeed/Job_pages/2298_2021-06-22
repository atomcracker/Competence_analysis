 As a chemical data scientist on this team, you will play a key role in building, validating, and deploying machine learning models to drive the design of oncology therapeutics. To ensure optimal predictive value you will contribute to data collection and acquisition strategy, tightly collaborating with computational and medicinal chemists, structural biologists, biophysicists, and other data scientists to assess druggability, guide synthesis decisions, and design experiments. Additionally, you will drive advances in technology and infrastructure through internal and external engagement to build a world-class data science environment that accelerates the path to medicines. 
 Duties 
 Collaborate with multi-disciplinary teams in the design of medicines. 
 Build quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for ADMET, physicochemical properties, selectivity, and potency. 
 Rigorously validate models with the appropriate metrics. 
 Deploy models into a modern service-based cloud infrastructure. 
 Integrate active learning into the design-make-test cycle 
 Maintain software, submit code patches upstream to open-source software as needed 
 Design and develop robust data analysis pipelines and software tools to drive molecule discovery. 
 Survey the literature for novel cheminformatics and QSAR methodology and algorithms, and introduce to the broader team when appropriate. 
 Work collaboratively with the Treeline team to apply and enhance computational infrastructure needed to drive our projects forward. 
 Manage vendor relationships, engage in external collaborations, and set a high standard for internal software engineering.
