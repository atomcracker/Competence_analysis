This summer SureStart is collaborating with the MIT RAISE Initiative to host a very exciting 6-week AI program called the   MIT FutureMakers Create-a-Thon ! The program, starting July 6th 2021, will bring together students from across the US to create a deliberately diverse group of learners, who are developing skills related to artificial intelligence, applied machine learning, affective computing, app development and entrepreneurship through a virtual program led by mentors. 
Weâ€™re looking for MIT App Inventor Master Trainers and/or Mobile CSP teachers  to assist the mentors  and the middle-school and high-school students participating in the program.

Assist and advise the mentors  as they train, support and encourage a small group of seven or eight students as they develop App development skills and Machine Learning knowledge using the provided App Inventor curriculum. 
Help answer questions  that the mentors and/or the students may have about MIT App Inventor. You are  not  required to teach or present. 
Help the mentors guide the students  use their newly-acquired App Inventor skills to build a larger project to complete the program. 
Help the mentors unblock the students  when they are stuck by pointing them to resources, showing them how to debug code and/or giving them helpful hints to discover the answer on their own.
