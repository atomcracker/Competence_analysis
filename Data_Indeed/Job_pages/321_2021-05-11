 About Northeastern: 
 
Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global research university and the recognized leader in experience-driven lifelong learning. Our world-renowned experiential approach empowers our students, faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond the confines of discipline, degree, and campus. 
 
Our locationsâ€”in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London; Portland, Maine; San Francisco; Seattle; Silicon Valley; Toronto; Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington and Nahantâ€”are nodes in our growing global university system. Through this network, we expand opportunities for flexible, student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused research. 
 
Northeasternâ€™s comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate programsâ€” in a variety of on-campus and online formatsâ€”lead to degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and careers. 
 
 About the Opportunity: 
 
In response to the shortage of researchers trained in AI, Northeastern seeks postdoctoral candidates from fields beyond computer science to grow its cadre of scholars in Artificial intelligence. 
 
Last year, Northeastern has launched a pioneering research and innovation hub in AIâ€”one that will shape the way humans and machines collaborate. Led by Dr. Usama Fayyad, the Experiential AI Institute is built around the challenges and opportunities made possible by human-machine collaboration. The institute provides a framework to design, implement, and scale AI-driven technologies in ways that make a true difference to society. Our ability to respond to the opportunities afforded to society will depend on training and building a workforce that is AI-capable. Located in Portland, Maine, with the goal of growing the Maine tech economy, the Roux Institute will be a center of activity for the Experiential AI Instituteâ€™s efforts. 
 
 Responsibilities: 
 
During a two-year postdoctoral appointment, Experiential AI Postdoctoral Fellows will take classes in AI and work with members of Northeasternâ€™s Experiential AI faculty. Of particular interest is AI applied to the life sciences, engineering, social sciences and to various aspects of cybersecurity. A listing of the teams of mentors who work in Experiential AI and are seeking postdoctoral fellows as part of this program may be found here: https://www.northeastern.edu/experientialai/faculty-mentors/ 
 
Successful applicants will spend 2 years with a team of mentors at the Boston and/or Portland campuses, and, at the conclusion, may be considered for faculty and staff research appointments at the Roux Institute or at one of Northeasternâ€™s other eight campuses (Boston, Burlington, Nahant, Seattle, San Francisco, San Jose, Vancouver, Toronto, London and Charlotte). 
 
 Qualifications: 
 
Candidates are not required to have any prior exposure to computer science or AI before beginning the program, but interest and/or significant experience in math is required. During the fellowship period, Northeastern will provide Computer Science and AI course work and research mentorship in Experiential AI to the post-doctoral scholars. Each two-year postdoctoral position will be provided with an annual salary of $60K 
 
 Preferred Qualifications: 
 
Salary Grade:

 Additional Information: 
 
The successful candidate will have a Ph.D. by the time of appointment. Although no previous experience or course work in AI is required, experience coding and significant course work in mathematics is a plus. 
 
Applications will be accepted and evaluated on a rolling basis, with the first evaluation period starting  March 15, 2021 ; successful applicants to this cohort-based program will begin their appointments on  July 1, 2021 .
