 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Machine Learning Engineer - Utah or US Remote DeepSee Draper, UT 84020 Remote Full-time Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description DeepSee.ai represents a new category of people-first automation solutions in the wake of frustration with the widespread failure of AI-powered productivity projects to deliver value. We’ve created the world’s first Knowledge Process Automation (KPA) platform to mine unstructured data, operationalize AI-powered insights, and automate results into real-time action for the enterprise. Taking AI-productivity from the lab and into production, the KPA suite is especially useful in highly regulated industries such as the capital markets and insurance verticals, with a business solution flow architecture designed to automate line-of-business problems leveraging the very latest innovations in semantic modeling and natural language processing, all while solving the deployment, scalability, and availability issues that plague most robotic AI initiatives. In a world where enterprises are swimming in data, but very little insight, DeepSee.ai is putting the power of AI and the advantages of knowledge in the hands of the humans. 
DeepSee is seeking a self-driven machine learning (ML) engineer with experience and passion for the creation and operationalization of natural language processing (NLP) machine learning models. We seek an individual who can leverage unstructured data, apply NLP and other ML techniques to deliver insights and solve real world business problems for our customers.
