 Job Description 
 SRI International’s Intellectual Property Legal department is looking for a smart, savvy, and dynamic IP attorney who is curious – loves to learn about new technology and is excited about the prospect of working on IP transactions. 
This individual would have the opportunity to work on commercial deals with SRI’s internal partners that involve the licensing of IP as well as deals spinning out SRI ventures. IP transactional work would also include advising on key IP provisions in US government contracts.

 Major Responsibilities include: 
Draft and negotiate IP licensing terms in commercial, government and IP licensing agreements 
Draft and negotiate inter-institutional agreements 
With an understanding of the technology and its associated patent protection, counsel SRI deal teams by defining IP licensing strategies – “what” IP to license and how to slice and dice the relevant IP for optimal licensing and with an eye towards subsequent deals 
Provide timely counsel on a variety of IP issues including patent, open source, trademark and copyright issues 
Supervise and provide substantive guidance to outside trademark counsel that will work with SRI to prepare and prosecute trademark applications based on SRI’s business needs 
Review and approve a high-volume of time-sensitive public release requests in the context of identifying the various, potentially competing business and IP rights preservation interests 
Other responsibilities (based on experience and interest): 
Collaborate with SRI management, business development staff, and technical teams to identify the most strategic areas for patent protection and portfolio growth 
Stimulate the generation of valuable invention disclosures through education and effective communication 
Supervise and provide substantive guidance to teams of outside patent professionals that will work with SRI to prepare and prosecute robust patent applications based on SRI’s invention disclosures and technical papers 
Define and implement practices to ensure that all SRI IP protection efforts – particularly patent applications and office action responses - are optimally aligned with technical, business, and intellectual property priorities 
 Qualifications 
 Juris Doctorate and a current member of a state bar 
2-3 years of experience drafting and reviewing IP provisions in license/commercial agreements and/or government contracts at a law firm or in house 
U.S. Citizen required 
Technical background in the computer, electrical or mechanical arts 
USPTO registration welcome (or interested in obtaining USPTO registration) 
Experience with open source issues and compliance a bonus, but not required

Excellent interpersonal skills including the ability to foster trust and respect and to create friendly and collaborative internal working relationships with internal clients 
Superb organizational skills and attention to detail, including the ability to prioritize and multi-task effectively 
Excellent written and oral communication skills, including presentations to senior business, technology, and legal personnel 
If you have at least 2-3 years of IP transaction (licensing) experience at a law firm or in house and a technical background in the computer, electrical or mechanical arts, we are interested in speaking with you! The role can also evolve to include a smaller mix of patent portfolio management work depending on the interest and experience of the individual.
