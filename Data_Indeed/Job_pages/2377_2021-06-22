 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Senior Narrative Designer, Virtual/Augmented Reality Axon 66 reviews Arizona Remote Axon 66 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. Our mission is to protect life.
 
We're out to make the world a safer place by solving big problems and taking on the public safety challenges of our time. From our company's inception building the TASER device to a full suite of hardware and software solutions, we are focused on providing police agencies with state-of-the-art devices and services they need to successfully serve and protect us. In the next few years, we're going to eliminate the burden of paperwork in policing, so officers can increase the time they spend building relationships and serving in their communities. We'll put video at the heart of police records so our justice system can get to the truth faster. And we won't stop innovating until the bullet is rendered obsolete.
