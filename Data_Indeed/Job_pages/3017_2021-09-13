 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Artificial Intelligence and Data Fusion Professional Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) 159 reviews Laurel, MD 20724 Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) 159 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. Do you have experience with data fusion and artificial intelligence / machine learning? 
 
Are you passionate about developing innovative technologies to solve technical challenges involving the defense of the US and her allies? 
 
If so, this is the perfect opportunity for you. 
 
The Advanced Information Technologies and Data Fusion Group (A4I) develops advanced algorithmic solutions to our nation's greatest technical challenges. Our group is seeking an innovative technical leader to develop and analyze novel solutions in the realm of data fusion, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), etc., as applied to critical DoD problems and data sets. We are very interested in someone who understands the underlying algorithmic assumptions and formulations when applying, developing, and implementing such techniques. 
 
 As a Data Fusion Professional your responsibilities will include: 
 
Developing state-of-the-art data fusion algorithms that leverage both physics-based state estimation and appropriately applied AI / ML techniques to current and future Air and Missile Defense problem sets 
Performing prototype implementation of the algorithms developed and demonstration with appropriate data sets
 Designing rigorous testing and validation methodologies to assess where/when AI/ML algorithms are applicable 
Developing state estimation approaches that eliminate use of simplifying textbook assumptions where limiting to applications 
Maintaining up-to-date knowledge of recent advances in the field 
Sharing knowledge by clearly articulating ideas in written documents and presentations to technical staff, management and government decision makers 
Collaborating with a technically diverse APL community to develop new potential applications of these techniques 
Interacting with various data types, formats and structures in a clear and appropriate manner to enable robust pre-processing, normalization or other manipulations as needed 
Mentoring early career engineers with regards to the state-of-the-art in data fusion domain 
 
Qualifications 
 
 You meet the minimum qualifications for this position if you have: 
 
A Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics, Engineering, Physics, Computer Science or equivalent
 At least five years professional work experience (years pursuing graduate degree may also be combined towards this qualification) 
Strong problem solving skills 
Experience with any of the following program languages: MATLAB, Python, C, C++, C#, or Java. with fluency in at least one 
Ability to rapidly translate and prototype state of the art algorithms to a variety of problem sets 
Experience dealing with large, real-world data sets 
Exposure to AI/ML, state estimation, and/or data fusion algorithms 
Excellent written and verbal communication skills 
An ability to obtain a Secret level security clearance. If selected, you will be subject to a government security clearance investigation and must meet the requirements for access to classified information. Eligibility requirements include U.S. citizenship. 
 
You'll go above and beyond our minimum requirements if you have: 
 
An MS or PhD in Mathematics, Engineering, Physics, Computer Science or equivalent
 At least eight years professional work experience 
Experience with detection and estimation theory, stochastic processes, Bayesian inference, and Markov models
 A solid theoretical understanding and experience using fundamental data fusion and tracking techniques such as Kalman filtering, batch-processing, multiple-hypothesis data association, multiple dynamic models, etc. 
Experience fusing across multiple sources whose data may exhibit characteristics such as sub-dimensioned, time-late, biased, and negative data 
Demonstrated experience in collaboration and version management systems 
An Active Top Secret/SCI Clearance
