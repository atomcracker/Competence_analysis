 Vectra directly analyzes network traffic in real time using combination of patent-pending data science, machine learning, and behavioral analysis to detect attacker behaviors and user anomalies in the network.

Apply cutting edge machine learning, artificial intelligence, and modeling techniques to stop hackers in real time as they attack networks. As part of the data science internship program, you will directly impact the product by developing new methods using cutting edge techniques to detect malicious and anomalous behaviors on the network.
