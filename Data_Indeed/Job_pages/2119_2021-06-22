Position description 
Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida is seeking a collaborative scientist to advance the clinical applications and translation of 7 Tesla MRI with a focus on brain imaging and neuroscience. Recent FDA approval of 7T MRI has provided the opportunity for routine use in clinical patients; however, substantial challenges remain in the translation of ultra-high field MRI. We are seeking candidates that may come from a variety of backgrounds who can contribute to novel approaches to help address some of these challenges. Example applications include, but are not limited to, MR image acquisition, reconstruction, sequence design, software engineering, advanced imaging processing, and computational methodology.
 The preferred candidate will possess a PhD in a relevant field such as engineering, mathematics, computer science, health science, physics, AI, or data analytics/quantitation. Current research funding is not required, but preferred. Candidates will be expected to make progress towards extramural funding within the first three years. The candidate would work alongside a highly qualified team of ultra-high field MR physicists and radiologists, with ample opportunity to collaborate with the Mayo Clinic artificial intelligence and image data science teams enterprise wide. The Research shield at Mayo Clinic is committed to creating a diverse environment and recognizes that diverse research teams make better decisions, are more equipped to solve complex problems and adapt to change, and produce better outcomes. That diversity is about opening up to unconventional ideas that create better outcomes, while recognizing colleagues' unique contributions.
