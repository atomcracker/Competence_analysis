 About the job 
Like Google's own ambitions, the work of a Software Engineer (SWE) goes way beyond just Search. Engineering Managers have not only the technical expertise to take on and provide technical leadership to major projects, but also manage a team of engineers. You not only optimize your own code but make sure engineers are able to optimize theirs. As an Engineering Manager you manage your project goals, contribute to product strategy and help develop your team. SWE teams work all across the company, in areas such as information retrieval, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security, data compression, user interface design; the list goes on and is growing every day. Operating with scale and speed, our exceptional software engineers are just getting started - and as a manager, you guide the way. 
 
The role of an Engineering Manager in the Application Platform group is to provide consistent clarity, focus, and leadership. You will do this through building trust with the teams and individuals over time. Good leaders have a high degree of personal integrity, commitment, and consistency.
