Sanofi tirelessly continues its path towards becoming a world-class biologics organization and it is expanding the capabilities in this area. The Global Digital Biologics Platform (DBxP) is one of the cornerstones of this ambition, through its mission and key objectives to establish and implement the digital strategy for Global Large Molecules Research (LMR). The LMR organization consists of five sites in the EU and the US, and approximately 550 personnel focused on antibodies, nanobodies and synthorins as therapeutic modalities. DBxP‚Äôs strategy begins with the core foundational approach to our data governance and extends to the implementation of advanced initiatives in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) to improve our workflows and increase our ability to deliver First-in-Class and Best-in-Class biologic drugs to the market. We have a comprehensive program ranging from deep-mining of antibody repertoire, developability prediction, multi-specific antibody design to in silico protein engineering and de novo protein design. We utilize unique in-house big data generation platforms as well as latest ML and NLP-based computing methods. 
This position will report to the Global Head of DBxP and will be responsible for overseeing daily project operations in digital foundational activities and digital innovation. She/he will be working with key collaborators across Sanofi including other DBxP site leads and application leads, ITS, DDS (Digital Data Sciences); other Research Platforms (e.g. DMPK, IDD, TS), Therapeutic Areas, Sanofi-Pasteur, and others as needed to advance our comprehensive global digital strategy. She/he will also help manage ongoing external collaborations with key academic institutions in the US and Europe, as well as industry partners. To create an impactful and differentiating group, we are searching for an interdisciplinary individual who has broad knowledge of LMR‚Äôs domain (biologics drug discovery and design) as well as computational experience. Furthermore, for this position, the individual should ideally be thinking holistically on the topic of ‚Äúdigital transformation‚Äù. This is a great opportunity to have a significant impact on the practice of drug discovery and on driving the modernization of a research organization. 
Key Accountabilities: 
Work with the Global Head of DBxP in managing the implementation of global DBxP digital policies and strategy, impacting an organization of ~550 FTEs. 
Establish global processes and systems for collecting, managing, and monitoring all computational site requirements, technical specifications and deployment processes; computational operational and innovation resources; and roadmaps for operationalizing ML/AI tools, technologies and workflows. 
Work with Site Leads to manage stakeholders, anticipate risks, plan and defend resource needs. 
Establish a system for managing metrics/KPIs relevant to digital transformation, data governance, operationalization of advanced technologies, impact on biologics discovery and engineering platform performance. 
Establish a process for global monitoring to ensure maintenance of computational platforms together with Digital Research and Digital and Data Sciences (e.g. ensuring update of predictive models with newly accumulated data). 
Be the supporting primary contact for internal and external LMR digital efforts; work with wider internal (listed above) and external Sanofi partners as needs arise. 
Work closely with DBxP Site Leads and DBxP Advanced Applications Lead(s) in US, France, Germany and Belgium to maximize synergies between technology development workstreams and technology innovation; proactive identification of computational opportunities by regular exchange with site leads. Conceptualize and lead cross-functional innovation workstreams. 
As part of DBxP LT, continuously contribute to digital strategy definition and global project prioritization. 
Drive operational excellence, develop and implement process improvements and innovative computational solutions, aligned with global DBxP and global LMRP strategy.

Successful in designing and executing strategic and operating plans and budgets. 
Solid understanding and keeping abreast of state of the art in computational opportunities in biologics discovery and development, including latest ML/AI methods. 
Preferred Qualifications: 
Demonstrated experience or proficiency in one or more of the following: ML/AI in antibody/nanobody discovery (e.g. mining NGS repertoire data), performance of sequence- or structure-based evolutionary analyses, structure determination, structure prediction, de novo antibody/nanobody/protein design, development of developability prediction models. 
LEAD skills: 
Operational excellence: project- and results-oriented, delivers on agreed objectives and on time; demands and drives scientific rigor and quality of execution; strives for more-better-faster. 
Organizational leadership: teamwork; decision making; ability to set clear directions and objectives, and to motivate/engage/guide/empower teams to execute; ability to embrace and implement organizational change.
