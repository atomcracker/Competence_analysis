The Roux Institute at Northeastern University in Portland, Maine is currently seeking a motivated Senior Computational Scientist to assist in conducting multidisciplinary projects. One of the initial projects, led by faculty at Northeastern University and the University Maine, is entitled ‚ÄúUsing artificial intelligence to examine the interplay between pacifier use and sudden infant death syndrome." This project is focused on examining how infant non-nutritive suck patterning in presence or absence of a pacifier can alter respiratory frequency and arousal levels during sleep periods. This study involves collecting video data using a baby monitor during at least one night of sleep as well as one daily nap from 30 full-term infants and therefore will result in an abundance of data to analyze. 
 
 Responsibilities: 
 
The main responsibility of this role will be in assisting in data analysis for various aspects of the project. The research scientist will support building a new fully annotated repository of infant video-based sleep data collected by the Behavioral Science sub-team and will enable the rapid testing and troubleshooting of the computer vision and machine learning algorithms developed by the Engineering sub-team. The Senior Computational Scientist will participate in a multidisciplinary environment and have opportunities to interact with researchers from Northeastern University, the Roux Institute in Portland, Maine, and University of Maine. 
 
 Qualifications: 
 
 MS or PhD degree in Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, or related fields 
 3+ years experience in Python programming 
 2+ years experience in Git and simple database management
