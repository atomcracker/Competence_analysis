JOB QUALIFICATIONS 
The Opportunity 
The successful candidates should hold a relevant PhD or terminal degree and will have a tenure home in one of the following college units:  Architecture, Construction Management, Interior Design, Landscape Architecture,  or  Urban and Regional Planning . A joint appointment between these units is possible. Competitive candidates should have demonstrated innovative research and education interests in one of the two following areas: 
Automated Design and Construction (Automation in Design or Construction Automation and Robotics), including but not limited to: 
Use of AI to anticipate and improve generative and parametric design & construction; 
Intelligent agents & distributed AI in design; 
Synthesis & integration of design, fabrication, & erection information; 
Construction robotics and human-robot team interactions. 
 2. Smart and Resilient Built Environments, including but not limited to: 
Use of AI to anticipate & improve resilience of human, built & natural environments; 
Advanced data analytics in the design & planning of environmental systems; 
Emergent hazards & adaptive responses to climate change-induced problems; 
Human-in-the-loop AI. 
Successful candidates will be positioned as key collaborators within DCP and take an active role in the burgeoning university-wide network of AI faculty.
