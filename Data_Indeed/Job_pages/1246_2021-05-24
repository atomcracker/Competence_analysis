 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Senior Software Engineer - Mission Capabilities - Cleared ANDURIL INDUSTRIES Irvine, CA Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description Anduril is a defense technology company, bringing Silicon Valley talent and funding to the defense sector. Our technology helps our customers solve their toughest challenges by enabling them to make better, more informed decisions in life-and-death situations. Weâ€™ve assembled a diverse team of experts in artificial intelligence, computer vision, sensor fusion, optics, and data analysis that are creating software and hardware solutions to radically evolve the capabilities of the United States and our allies. If you are passionate about solving problems that have real impact, come join Anduril and build the future of defense. 
As a Senior Software Engineer on the Mission Capabilities team, you own the architecture and deployment of software solutions that support specific customer missions. 
Your efforts ensure that Anduril products seamlessly work together to achieve a variety of critical outcomes. Sentry Towers, Ghost Drones, Dust, Flux, and Catalyst are just a few of the Anduril products you leverage and extend to support capabilities such as Base Protection, Maritime Domain Awareness, and Counter Drone. 
 
 You expand the meaning of â€˜full stack developerâ€™ as you touch backend and frontend cloud components as well as distributed edge compute and raw sensors. Some days you write code to add a mission-critical feature to an existing product. Some days you go to the field to coordinate real-world testing of your new feature with other supporting product teams. Some days everything works beautifully. Some days nothing works and you have to figure out whatâ€™s broken. 
As a mission capability evolves from crazy-idea to demo to pilot to program of record, you advance the software solution to the appropriate level of functionality and robustness. You report into the engineering organization so that gaps are not just duct-taped over but actually fixed at the core. 
 
 Through every stage, you collaborate with and are supported by a variety of teams in engineering, operations, and business development. You make messy real world data understandable with the Perception team. You may temporarily embed in a product team or developers from other teams may embed with you in the Mission. SREs, Customer Success, and Technical Operations work closely with you to scale deployment setup, monitoring, and support. You work closely with account managers, product managers, and product teams to prioritize limited resources across ambitious goals and timelines. 
 What You'll do
 Own the software solutions that are deployed to customers 
Write code to improve products and scale the mission capability to more customers 
Collaborate across multiple teams to plan, build, and test complex functionality 
Create and analyze metrics that are leveraged for debugging and monitoring 
Triage issues, root cause failures, and coordinate next-steps 
Empathize with end-users to turn needs into features while balancing user experience with engineering constraints 
Travel up to 50% of time to build, test, and deploy capabilities in the real world 
 Required Qualifications 
Strong engineering background from industry or school, ideally in areas/fields such as Computer Science, Software Engineering, Mathematics, or Physics. 
1+ years building software solutions involving significant amounts of data processing/analysis 
U.S. Citizenship status is required as this position will require the ability to access U.S. only data systems and export controlled data.
 An active security clearance (Secret, Top Secret, TS with SCI) or equivalent
 5+ years of programming experience 
Ability to quickly understand and navigate complex systems and established code bases 
Leadership experience a plus 
A desire to work on critical software that has a real-world impact
