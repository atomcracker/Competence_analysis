Participation in the Research Internship Program requires that you are  physically  located in the United States or Canada for the duration of the internship. 
Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers. Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment. 
The Office of Applied Research in Microsoft seeks outstanding research interns to conduct state-of-the-art applied research. Applied research is impact-driven research. It takes experimental techniques and applies them to real world problems in a way that transforms innovation from theory into reality, advancing the state-of-the-art in the process. 
The Office of Applied Research brings together experts from Artificial Intelligence (AI), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Computational Social Science (CSS). We work closely with research and product partners to help to ensure Microsoft is doing cutting edge research towards our core product interests. We are particularly interested in candidates with experience in AI (e.g., natural language processing, recommender systems, causal inference, machine learning, reinforcement learning), HCI (e.g. human-centered AI, human-in-the-loop systems, crowdsourcing, machine teaching, mixed-methods research, intelligent user interfaces) and CSS (e.g., computational sociology, social network analysis). 
Responsibilities 
Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the worldâ€™s best researchers, interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, students are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.
