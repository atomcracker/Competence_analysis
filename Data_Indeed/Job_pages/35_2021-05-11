Purpose: 
The Biosciences Division (BSD), https://www.ornl.gov/bsd, in the Biological and Environmental Systems Science (BESS) Directorate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), https://www.ornl.gov, is seeking to launch new capabilities and hire scientific leaders to advance these efforts. ORNL recently introduced a new scientific leadership structure, with Sections and Groups aligned to the future of the lab. Located on the Reimagining ORNL website are brief descriptions of the BESS directorate and these Sections/Groups. 
 
BSD is an interdisciplinary research and development organization with 60+ years of achievement in bioenergy and biomedical research. Our vision is to expand scientific knowledge and develop innovative strategies and technologies that will strengthen the nationâ€™s leadership in creating solutions to harness the power of biological systems to address technological challenges in energy, health and the environment. Our staff explore the emergent properties of biological systems, from genes and pathways to organisms and communities; apply synthetic biology and gene editing technologies to engineer organisms with prescribed traits; advance technologies for dynamic imaging of molecular and cellular systems; and advance next-generation modeling, simulation and data analytics to extract and transfer information to understand biological systems and their representation in quantitative models. 
 
We are especially interested to nucleate and expand programs around the following areas: 
 Computational and experimental cryoEM  â€“ characterization and modeling of biomolecular structure and dynamics through the use of cryogenic electron microscopy, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing techniques
 Image Analytics and Edge Computing  â€“ the development of tools for real time plant phenotyping based on hyperspectral, thermal, LIDAR and multi-omics data
 Cell Structure and Dynamics  â€“ super-resolution microscopies and relevant cellular modeling techniques with particular application to plant and microbial systems
 Quantum Biology  â€“ emerging applications of quantum phenomena to measurement and sensing in biological and environmental systems
 Protein Interactions â€“  Mass spectrometry-based approaches for characterizing high order protein structure, such as those using native mass spectrometry technologies, or structural interrogations (isotopic exchange, covalent labeling, cross-linking), or interactions (protein:protein, protein:ligand). Goal will be to interface and collaborate with novel neutron and x-ray based structural methods at ORNL. 
Fluxomics  â€“ Mass spectrometry-based approaches for measuring biomolecular interactions, dynamics, and pathways, in particular using stable-isotope labeling
 Biomaterials  â€“ sustainable production of materials from plant biomass and relevant biotechnology research, including biomanufacturing and 3D printing applications; materials upcycling 
Phage Biology  â€“ interest in discovery, isolation and characterization of phages and influence on host-microbe, microbe-microbe interactions within soil and plant associated ecosystems and developing phage-based applications to synthetic biology and genetic engineering 
Plant Root Phenotyping  â€“ Root and rhizosphere phenotyping, imaging, and editing to enhance belowground interactions 
Molecular Ecology  â€“ Population genetics and molecular ecology of plants and fungi 
Biosecurity & Biodefense  â€“ Novel approaches to detecting and tracking the movement of biological agents; Advancing methods to anticipate, identify and mitigate direct and indirect bioengineered threats to the ecosystem, healthcare and crops. 
Biological Materials for Defense  â€“ Convergence of synthetic biology with materials science and chemical engineering 
Biomedical Research  â€“ Securing the drug supply chain; Applications of energy technologies to targeted medicine
