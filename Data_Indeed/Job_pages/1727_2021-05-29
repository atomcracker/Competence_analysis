 Program Overview 
WRI is launching a major new initiative (provisionally called Land & Carbon Watch) that will use land and carbon monitoring to catalyze the land-based actions, policies, incentives and governance reforms needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. WRI and partners will leverage a combination of ground data, satellite data and other cutting-edge technologies to monitor all the worldâ€™s lands, natural ecosystems, working lands and associated carbon stocks and flows. The initiative builds on existing monitoring initiatives and data platforms such Global Forest Watch and Resource Watch. The system will provide communities, governments, investors, non-government organizations, and others with high-quality data to help them pursue nature-based solutions that address the climate crisis in ways that also support economic recovery, promote equity, protect biodiversity, and enhance resilience.
