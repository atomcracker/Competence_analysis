 Along with your talent for stakeholder management, you are a self-starter, and are comfortable with ambiguity. You are a customer advocate and are used to influencing without authority.

You will nurture and rapidly expand existing partnerships, generate new leads, demonstrate results, and play an important role in growing Amazon‚Äôs AI development capability.

You‚Äôll commission and manage pilots for them and propose solutions to their unique requirements. This is a new and rapidly growing area for ADS, so you‚Äôll also be spending a lot of time inventing and then re-inventing the mechanisms and artifacts that will let us scale at pace. You‚Äôll improve the way we work, streamlining and simplifying our processes so they become more frictionless both for us and our customers.

You are able to separate what's important from what's urgent, find the best path forward from among multiple scenarios, earn the trust of stakeholders, and improve the efficiency of our organization.
 Handling the volume of data our customers need us to process is not trivial. Be under no illusions ‚Äì this is a complex space. When things do go wrong (and they will), you‚Äôre happy to dive deep and get to the real detail so we can learn and benefit from our mistakes. Dealing with risks and issues is meat and drink to you. You‚Äôll need to be a confident communicator, both spoken and written; we thrive on the written word! You can create and present clear, concise and actionable documents, whether working with customers, or providing updates to business leadership. Your communications skills also help create wide bridges between us and our customers, so that we avoid silos and work in partnership to deliver the best results.
 Amazon‚Äôs customers are an obsession for us, and they will be for you. We take their privacy and data security as our overriding priority. This will be evident from the moment you walk through the door.
 We pride ourselves on our agility; market conditions change quickly and that means that dealing with urgent, last-minute requests is the rule rather than the exception! You will be prepared for the unexpected and will be used to adapting your plans to handle it.
 Above all, you‚Äôll deliver results in a fast paced, exciting environment!
