Consumer Data Science Product Management
 WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR 
 We are looking for a Lead Visualization Developer that is passionate about designing products powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. In this senior role, weâ€™re looking for someone that doesnâ€™t just provide a service to make our products beautiful, but more importantly, they help us discover the right products to build. Weâ€™re looking for someone that knows that customer experience is as important to customer value as is the underlying functionality of the product. 
What will you work on
 This person will development and own a program focused creating mock-ups and prototypes for data products to ultimately accelerate data science innovation. This will include translating data science results into data visualizations or user interfaces that business stakeholders and analysts will use. Youâ€™ll develop and implement robust data visualization and dashboarding solutions to enable business decisions, drive performance and lead to the accomplishment of strategic initiatives. Your work will inform the functionality of our AI / ML data products & model outputs just as much as the functionality drives design of data products. You will provide design recommendations to all of the touch points and interactions a customer will have with Consumer Data Science products throughout the products lifetime (inclusive of core design, ancillary, and auxiliary product components). Some of these data products will result in data visualizations or UI that business stakeholders and analysts will then use. Example projects might include Tableau dashboards for a newly developed metric, interactive visualization of merchandise clusters in D3, or a Javascript-based UI for interacting with a new predictive model. The aim of most projects will be to gain user adoption, begin influencing key business decisions, and then â€˜graduateâ€™ the code to an engineering team to be further built out. Additionally, you will develop, design, and share processes and methods to build out the design team on Consumer Data Sciences Product Management. This will include mentorship and coaching for visualization developers on the team. 
Who will you work with
 Youâ€™ll work closely with senior leaders, including product managers and data scientists, on the Consumer Data Science team from the very inception of ideas through the delivery and sustainment of data products while influencing design decisions at each step of the way. Consumer Data Science teams span across Product Design & Merchandising (Footwear & Apparel), Nike Direct (Core Commerce, Direct to Consumer, Nike Run Club & Nike Training Club), and Marketing and Brand (Targeted Marketing and Content). Youâ€™ll also plan an integral role in the Product discovery phase as you lead discovery interviews directly with customers to uncover explicit and implicit pain points. Youâ€™ll help mentor and coach other analytics professionals in utilizing best practices in data visualization. This role will be part of the Consumer Data Sciences Product Management team and report directly to the Director, Data Science Product.
