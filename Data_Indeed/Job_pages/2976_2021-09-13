 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Data Scientist Pison Boston, MA Pison is creating the next generation of neural interfaces that focus on gesture recognition and neurophysiological insights. Pison leverages our patented electroneurography (ENG) platform to translate data generated from our body's natural physiological electricity stemming at the brain into machine interpretable events in software. This allows for never before seen intuitive control of any experience in the IoT universe and discovery of neurological correlations drawn from our proprietary AI and data sets. Pison's government, Department of Defense and Fortune 100 customers have a deep pipeline of pending projects fueling our growth. Pison's long term vision is to own the platform which translates human intention to machine-readable code. 
 
As a member of the Machine Learning team at Pison Technology, the Data Scientist will support the machine learning research and production pipelines through data collection, data cleaning, signal processing, and signal analysis. Additionally, the Data Scientist will work with machine learning engineers in model research/development and evaluation. The Data Scientist will not only collect/gather data used for training/tuning models and for performing benchmarking tests on these models to predict real-time performance, but will participate in carrying out these experiments.
