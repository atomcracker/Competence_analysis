Do you want to work at a high-growth company where your impact is seen and rewarded? Are you looking for the autonomy to do your best work? We are seeking a Developer Advocate to empower developers to innovate and build voice applications with Rev.ai's world-class ASR APIs. This role will report directly to the GM of Rev.ai.
 
Developer advocates have two main focuses. The first is to educate developers about Rev.ai and ASR through speaking at events, creating live and recorded video content, writing, appearing on podcasts, and other creative mediums. The second is to serve the larger developer community by answering questions and listening to feedback on forums, GitHub, social media, and Slack and Discord servers. You'll then take that information and share it with other marketing, engineering, and documentation teams at Rev.ai to help improve our developer experience. These two objectives also include collaborating with engineering teams, working on open source libraries, and building internal tooling and reporting applications. For all of these tasks, you will measure your impact both quantitatively and qualitatively and adjust course as needed.
 
Responsibilities
 
You will be the first to try new APIs and products. You're not afraid to roll your sleeves up to write code snippets and sample applications. Even better, you can articulate ways they can be improved to make all developers' lives easier.
 You will take complex topics and make them accessible to developers of different experience levels.
 You will educate the developer community via speaking engagements, meetups and conferences.
 
Qualifications
 
5+ years experience as a web, security or full stack developer.
 You are embedded into the NodeJS or Python community
 Once in-person events resume, you're able and willing to travel 30% to speak at events
 You are a strong independent contributor, but you enjoy collaborating with teammates and multi-functional teams
 You are comfortable learning multiple skills simultaneously and managing multiple projects at once
 Your passion for technology inspires you to explore your curiosity; you love learning new things
 You find a fast-paced, constantly iterative environment engaging and stimulating
 You can write and speak proficiently in English
