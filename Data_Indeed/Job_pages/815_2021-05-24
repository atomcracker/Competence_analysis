For more than 14 years, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been the worldâ€™s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud computing platform. What is cloud computing? Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, companies can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from AWS. AWS offers over 175 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 77 Availability Zones (AZs) across 24 geographic regions. AWS services are trusted by millions of active customers around the world - including the fastest-growing start-ups, largest enterprises, and leading government agenciesâ€”to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs.
