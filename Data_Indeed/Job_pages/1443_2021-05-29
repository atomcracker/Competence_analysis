Research Associate â€“ Hydrology and Climate Change 
Biological and Environmental Engineering,
 Cornell University 
Location: Ithaca, NY 
 
 Starting Date: July 1, 2021 
Position Summary 
The Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University seeks a research associate to investigate (1) long-term water supply and flooding risks under climate change in complex water systems across the United States and globally and (2) innovative computational approaches for advanced forecasts of hydrology and water system response at subseasonal-to-seasonal scales. For both projects, this individual will perform independent research on advanced machine learning / artificial intelligence (ML/AI) approaches and process-based modeling for climate and hydrologic simulation, forecasts, and projections. This individual will also support and assist graduate student and postdoctoral work toward the production and evaluation of water system vulnerability to climate variability and change, and will work collaboratively with other research groups on campus and nationally. The ultimate goal of both projects is to develop improved methods for water system adaptation under deep uncertainty that can be adopted by real-world practitioners, in order to help navigate growing societal conflicts for water. 
Ideal candidates would have some experience with two or more of the following: machine learning models for water quantity and/or water quality modeling, process-based models for water quantity and/or quality modeling, uncertainty analysis in hydrologic modeling, non-stationary frequency analysis of extreme events, stochastic weather generation, downscaling of regional and global climate model output, high-performance computing, and work in hydrologic settings around the nation and globally. 
The position includes a 12-month initial appointment, available starting July 1, 2021, with the possibility for renewal pending satisfactory performance, funding and available work. 
Duties and Responsibilities 
Design and perform computational experiments to test hypotheses on described projects. Collect and organize relevant data. Organize research results into clear presentations with figures and tables as appropriate. Share research results with PI and research group in regular meetings . (60%)
