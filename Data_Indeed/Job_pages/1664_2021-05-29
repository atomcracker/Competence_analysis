 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search This job has expired on Indeed Reasons could include: the employer is not accepting applications, is not actively hiring, or is reviewing applications Computational Science Postdoc Fellow Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory San Francisco Bay Area, CA The Advanced Light Source Division at Berkeley Lab is seeking a Computational Science Postdoc Fellow to work on the development of a user-friendly platform for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tools (AI/ML) to accelerate research, with an emphasis on imaging applications. 
 
The ALS is a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science national scientific user facility whose excellent scientific reputation, expert staff, and capabilities in the soft x-ray, hard x-ray, and infrared regimes attract more than 2,000 academic and industrial users each year in disciplines spanning physical, chemical, materials, biological, energy, and Earth sciences. It is one of five Berkeley Lab user facilities that serve a combined 11,000 users annually. The co-location of these user facilities â€“ including the Molecular Foundry Nanoscale Science Research Center and the NERSC scientific computing center, as well as Berkeley Lab's outstanding programs in materials and chemical sciences among others â€“ offers a prime environment for collaborative science. The ALS has been a global leader in soft x-ray science for more than two decades and is currently undertaking a new project (ALS-U) that will endow the facility with state-of-the-art x-ray capabilities. It's an exciting time to join our growing team! 
 
The core values of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) reflect a strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We seek candidates who will support a culture in which the entire ALS community feels welcomed and valued. An ongoing commitment to recruiting a vibrant, diverse, and talented workforce is paramount to promoting a diverse lab community. 
 
 What You Will Do: 
 The postdoc will contribute to the conceptual design, development, and optimization of a platform for AI/ML-guided analysis of data available across various DOE user facilities, with an emphasis on images. 
 The postdoc will report to Dula Parkinson, Program Lead for Diffraction & Imaging at the ALS. 
 Work with others on the team to design, develop, and improve the ability of the AI/ML-guided analysis platform to handle multi-modal, multi-dimensional image data. 
 Develop AI/ML approaches for filtering, upsampling, and segmenting ALS image data. 
 Develop AI/ML approaches for transfer learning and evaluate the effectiveness of transfer learning. 
 Develop and evaluate methods for reverse image search. 
 Develop multi-modal AI/ML methods that enable data from multiple sources-including both image and non-image data-to be leveraged. 
 Develop user-friendly interfaces for enabling domain scientists who are not AI/ML experts to use the above tools, and work with domain scientists to deploy and evaluate the tools, including providing training and documentation. 
 
 What is Required: 
 Ph.D. degree in the Physical Sciences, Material Science, Applied Mathematics, Computer Science or a related discipline 
 Demonstrated record of scientific excellence (for example, through publications, talks, or software products). 
 Experience with scientific software development, and with the open-source scientific Python software stack 
 Experience working in a team environment and ability to work collaboratively with a diverse group of scientists and engineers, especially in a distributed environment 
 Some knowledge of AI and ML principles and practices 
 
 Desired Qualifications: 
 Experience with neutron or X-ray techniques 
 Experience using or working with data from a synchrotron light source or another major user facility 
 Experience contributing to open-source software projects 
 Familiarity with widely-used AI/ML libraries such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow 
 Experience with image processing or application of AI/ML to images, for example for filtering or segmentation; experience working with 3D image data is also desired 
 
 This position will remain open until filled. 
 
 Notes: 
 This is a full-time, 3-year, postdoctoral appointment with the possibility of renewal based upon satisfactory job performance, continuing availability of funds, and ongoing operational needs. 
 You must have less than 2 years of paid postdoctoral experience. 
 Salary for Postdoctoral positions depends on years of experience post-degree. 
 Salary will be predetermined based on postdoctoral step rates. 
 This position is represented by a union for collective bargaining purposes. 
 This position may be subject to a background check. Any convictions will be evaluated to determine if they directly relate to the responsibilities and requirements of the position. Having a conviction history will not automatically disqualify an applicant from being considered for employment. 
 Work will be primarily performed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, CA.
