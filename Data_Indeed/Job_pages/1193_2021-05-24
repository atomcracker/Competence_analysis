 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Senior AI Engineer / AI Scientist Mythic-AI San Francisco Bay Area, CA Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description About us: 
Mythic's platform delivers the power of desktop GPU in a single low-power chip, supporting inference for large deep neural networks. Mythic's technology is based upon an entirely new hybrid digital/analog flash calculation using 8-bit non-volatile memory arrays which has been under development since 2012. This step change in performance brings in a range of new applications in a broad array of verticals, including safety and security, autonomous vehicles, VR/AR, robotics and media. 
Mythic is a fast-growing company with 100+ employees, $86M in funding from top tier investors, and >$1M NRE revenue from two existing customer accounts. Mythicâ€™s investors include Softbank, DFJ, Lux Capital, and Data Collective. 
About the role: 
Mythicâ€™s AI hardware combines knowledge across many domains, including AI, compilers, computer architecture, analog circuits, and non-volatile memories. Mythic will enable the future of AI by building analog-compute hardware platforms that are 100-1000x more efficient than conventional all-digital systems. This vision comes together on the AI Engineering team, where our expertise is used to develop AI algorithms and models which are optimized for our hardware, as well as to provide guidance to Mythicâ€™s hardware and compiler teams who are building our hardware and compiler platforms. If living at the intersection of AI and hardware sounds exciting to you, this role is for you. 
This team significantly impacts Mythic by: Developing reduced-precision mathematics techniques for neural networks and AI. This includes quantization into 8-bit and below, as well as modeling the impact of analog compute techniques. Working with computer architecture team on new compute units specialized for AI. Investigating new features for our compiler that leverage the adaptability of neural networks. Developing new neural networks that are optimized for our hardware products. 
This role is not location specific. However, candidates will be expected to keeping working hours in line with either Pacific or Central Time.
