 Collaborated with a large development team to ensure that requirements such as design-for-testability (DFT) are met in the project as a whole.
 NVIDIA gives automakers, tier-1 suppliers, automotive research institutions, and start-ups the power and flexibility to develop and deploy breakthrough artificial intelligence (AI) systems for self-driving vehicles. NVIDIA's unified AI computing architecture enables training deep neural networks in the data center on the NVIDIA DGX-1â„¢, and then seamlessly runs them on NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 inside the vehicle. This end-to-end approach uses NVIDIA DriveWorks software and allows cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle. We believe that realizing self-driving cars will be a defining contribution of our generation (e.g. traffic accidents are responsible for ~1.25 million deaths per year worldwide). We have the funding and scale, but we need your help on our team. NVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology worldâ€™s most desirable employers. We have some of the most forward-thinking and creative people in the world working for us. Are you hardworking, persistent, autonomous and love a challenge? If so, we want to hear from you.
