Job details Salary $54,540 - $65,000 a year Job Type Full-time Full Job Description PIT-UN Postdoc Researcher - School of Information - University of California, Berkeley
 
 Description: 
Professor Deirdre Mulligan and Associate Professor Jenna Burrell are seeking a Postdoc Researcher to work on a year-long project funded through the Public Interest Technology - University Network's, (PIT-UN) 2020 Network Challenge Grants.
 
The Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity working Group (AFOG) was founded in 2017 with a research gift from Google and is made up of UC Berkeley faculty, postdocs, and graduate students at UC Berkeley. Our aim is to develop new ideas, research directions, and policy recommendations around issues of fairness, transparency, interpretability, and accountability in algorithm-based systems. AFOG hosts an ongoing speaker series and a biweekly informal lunch discussion group that has been useful for researchers to share early stage and ongoing research. We have a strong track record of placing alums in PIT positions in the private and public sectors. Scholars who have joined us have gone on to work at the AI Now Institute at NYU, the Partnership on AI, the People and AI Research team at Google, and the Aether ( AI, Ethics and Effects in Engineering and Research ) team at Microsoft.
 
 Appointment Length: 
This is a full time, one year position with the possibility of being extended subject to performance and budgetary approval. Anticipated start date is June 2021.
 
This position is housed within the Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Working Group ( https://afog.berkeley.edu/ ) and will work directly with Professor Deirdre Mulligan and Associate Professor Jenna Burrell as part of the Algorithmic, Fairness, and Opacity Group (AFOG), and will meet with and benefit from the advising and mentorship of Diana Lizarraga, Director of Cal NERDS and Claudia Natalia von Vacano PhD, Executive Director of the D-Lab.
 
The PIT-UN postdoc will help to develop a cohort of undergraduates and junior scholars as public interest technologists through skill building, reflection, critical service learning, and connections to the field of algorithmic justice.
 
In this role you will partner to develop programming with the D-Lab and Cal NERDS. This postdoc position will help undergrads to deepen technical skills, explore the social and political implications of algorithmic systems, and provide onramps into the PIT field. Hands-on workshops will surround formal curriculum in information and data science, and extend AFOG's existing research, workshops, and public speaker series. Public lectures and lunch talks will grow students' understanding and connections to the field. Through AFOG Reflection and Critical Technical Practice Workshops, students will reflect on what it means to practice ethically and in the public interest, exploring issues of power, identity, and expertise, and their role as a professional, an employee, an expert, and a member of the public in relation to the public good, social justice and social change. You will also organize four PIT-UN related workshops and help support Cal NERDS to develop their STEMinist post-bootcamp programming, and support other activities as needed. You will work with the PIs to develop and apply metrics to assess the success of the PITUN grant activities in cultivating an undergraduate PIT cohort. In addition, you will be incorporated into the D-Lab Data Science Fellows community and will be expected to present one time in an information internal talk series.
 
You will dedicate 50% of your time to this effort and will have the freedom to pursue your own AFOG related research, in collaboration with the PIs or other AFOG members. We are interested in many areas of algorithmic justice, but especially research that explores the effects of AI systems on the ground, expands the Solution Space' for responsible AI including improved algorithms, interface designs, legal reforms, improved organizational policies and processes, collective action, and social movements, and research on educational approaches that help technical think deeply and critically about technology, human values, and the social and political implications of technical systems.
 Support for this position is provided by the Public Interest Technology University Network Challenge Fund, a fiscally sponsored project of New Venture Fund. The Public Interest Technology University Network's challenge grants are funded through the support of the Ford Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, Mastercard Impact Fund with support from Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, The Raikes Foundation, Schmidt Futures and The Siegel Family Endowment.

Research interest in educational approaches to cultivating social/political/ethical awareness in technical fields.
 
Candidates with knowledge of and sensitivity to the challenges faced by students and scholars from non-dominant groups, the structural barriers that stand in their way, and how to tackle those challenges both through mentoring and by addressing institutional power structures directly are encouraged to apply.
 
Able to grasp technical aspects of machine learning and artificial intelligence and also trained in and comfortable with interpretivist / non-positivist research methods or philosophies.
 
Expertise in a particular domain where machine learning or artificial intelligence tools and techniques are becoming influential (i.e. education, labor and employment, journalism and media).
