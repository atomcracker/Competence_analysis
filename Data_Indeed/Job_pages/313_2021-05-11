 Manager, Platform Strategy, Cyber & Intelligence Solutions
 Who is Mastercard?
 
Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry. Our mission is to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere by making transactions safe, simple, smart, and accessible. Using secure data and networks, partnerships and passion, our innovations and solutions help individuals, financial institutions, governments, and businesses realize their greatest potential.
 
Our decency quotient, or DQ, drives our culture and everything we do inside and outside of our company. With connections across more than 210 countries and territories, we are building a sustainable world that unlocks priceless possibilities for all. 
 
 
 
The Cyber & Intelligence (C&I) group develops solutions that build trust in the converging worlds of physical-world payments, digital payments and cybersecurity. Building upon a foundation of products that ensure payments are convenient, safe and secure, the C&I teamâ€™s remit is rapidly expanding to include new technologies such as artificial intelligence, digital identity and cybersecurity. Our customers include issuers, acquirers, merchants, processors, governments and consumers. We continue to create competitive advantage for Mastercard organically through the innovation of new solutions and inorganically through acquisitions.
 
 
The Platform Strategy team plays a critical role in defining, building and managing the shared services and capabilities across the Cyber and Intelligence business unit. We publish and promote common design principles that make our services reusable, easier to bundle, and quicker to market. We provide frameworks and guidance for important architectural concepts like API, Cloud and Data Modelling. Finally, we help synchronize product & technology roadmaps across our entire business, making sure that the individual pieces come together seamlessly to support the C&I Strategy.
 
 
This role works directly with the Platform Leads and other C&I Leaders to help formulate strategy and more importantly, take strategy-to-action. They will be responsible for driving the tactical execution of things such as Multi-Rail, M&A Integration, and building the long-term platform roadmap, to name a few. This will require clearly defined outcomes, action plans, and KPIs across all our strategic objectives. This person will also play a key role in establishing a more regular interaction model between C&I Platform, C&I Product, and our various acquisitions. An ability to bring people together, bridge organizational boundaries, and promote synergies amongst disparate product & engineering teams is a must in this position. Finally, this person will manage the overall operations and reporting of the Platform Strategy team, establishing and running regular review sessions, driving action items across the team, and reporting on our internal objectives and KPIs.
