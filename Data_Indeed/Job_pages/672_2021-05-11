The mission for the role

 Reporting into the Head of Business Development in the UK, you'll be helping Attest grow our new business pipeline in North America through qualifying cold prospects and creating opportunities for our Account Executives to convert into revenue. 
 
 This is a unique and exciting opportunity to join a well-established European start-up on its journey of expanding in the US and beyond. It's a chance to play a key role in our success, and you'll be selling a product that marketeers love! 
 
 What you'll be doing

 You'll nurture great relationships with potential customers by phone, email & social media channels to engage them in conversation with Attest. 
 You'll carry out initial qualification to identify prospect pain points and challenges whilst aligning the Attest solution and the benefits it provides our customers. 
 You'll communicate the various value propositions of the Attest platform to multiple stakeholders through account-based selling. 
 You'll become a trusted advisor, able to educate and advise prospects on how the Attest platform can help them. 
 You'll match and contribute to the positive attitude, high levels of energy and drive already established in the team. 
 You'll strive to meet and exceed realistic, achievable quotas.
