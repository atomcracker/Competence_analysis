 About the job 
 
At Google weâ€™re committed to improving the lives of as many people as possible. One of the most important areas in which weâ€™re striving to do that is health. 
 Today weâ€™re studying the use of artificial intelligence to assist in diagnosing cancer, predicting patient outcomes, preventing blindness, and much more. Weâ€™re exploring ways to improve patient care, including tools that are already being used by clinicians.
 We are looking for an experienced Human Factors Engineering (HFE) leader to play a key role in bringing innovative medical devices to market by planning, managing, and overseeing HFE activities across Google Healthâ€™s portfolio. You will work closely with our Quality, Regulatory, Safety, and User Experience Research (UXR) teams to establish a robust, dedicated HFE program at Google Health by creating efficient, scalable processes, advising on Human Factors across the organization, and training User Experience and product teams to support our portfolio of products on regulated medical device pathways. 
 You will collaborate with product teams to develop timelines for regulatory HFE activities, identify use-related risks, and drive documentation for regulated products. Youâ€™ll develop task lists, conduct task analysis, analyze predicate devices and known use errors, and work closely with the UXR team to plan and execute studies. Youâ€™ll also drive formative and summative evaluations by working with cross-functional teams (e.g. Quality, Regulatory, Safety, UXR, Product, Engineering) to define critical tasks, author usability validation protocols, execute studies, and prepare summative reports for submissions. We are seeking a strong teammate with deep experience conducting HFE work and a passion for building safe, effective medical devices. 
Google Health has made major advances in healthcare research, such as detecting eye disease more quickly and accurately than experts, planning cancer radiotherapy treatment in seconds rather than hours, and working to detect patient deterioration before it happens with electronic records. 
 
Fundamental research is at the core of Google Health - the multidisciplinary team collaborates with partners to publish novel research in renowned scientific journals. They then work to apply this research into the medical field, whether through Streams, our clinical assistant app, or other clinical hardware and products developed in Google. Working alongside colleagues across Google, youâ€™ll help make this vision a reality. 
Responsibilities 
 Develop internal Human Factors processes to ensure consistency, compliance and efficiency, and provide HFE training to product teams. 
 Develop timelines for formative research and lead strategy for summative validation studies which includes development of safety-critical tasks, creating test plans/protocols, and writing validation reports. 
 Execute, summarize, and organize formative and summative research in partnership with UXR. Advise teams on required HF activities in accordance with FDA guidance and other relevant international standards (e.g., IEC 62366, AAMI HE75, ISO 14971). 
 Interact with regulatory authorities during face-to-face meetings and in written responses. 
 Map and anticipate organization-wide HFE needs and scale the HFE program appropriately. Present to senior leaders a comprehensive HF strategy and implementation plan.
