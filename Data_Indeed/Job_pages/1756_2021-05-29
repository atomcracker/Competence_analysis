 Postdoctoral Associates are temporary Academic Professionals dedicated to the pursuit of greater professional expertise after the attainment of the doctoral degree. This category recognizes that doctoral recipients in some disciplines may require intensive advanced work in a particular discipline before seeking permanent employment. Postdoctoral Associates are not eligible for extended-term appointments. It is characteristic of Postdoctoral Associates to work with a small set of faculty mentors who are responsible for directing the employee’s research and training. The temporary nature of internships, the precariousness of grant funding, and the desire of many Postdoctoral Associates to acquire permanent employment early in their careers call for a specific set of governing regulations for this category of employee.
