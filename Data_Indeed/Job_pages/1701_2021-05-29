 About Northeastern: 
 
Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global research university and the recognized leader in experience-driven lifelong learning. Our world-renowned experiential approach empowers our students, faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond the confines of discipline, degree, and campus. 
 
Our locationsâ€”in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London; Portland, Maine; San Francisco; Seattle; Silicon Valley; Toronto; Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington and Nahantâ€”are nodes in our growing global university system. Through this network, we expand opportunities for flexible, student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused research. 
 
Northeasternâ€™s comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate programsâ€” in a variety of on-campus and online formatsâ€”lead to degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and careers. 
 
 About the Opportunity: 
 
In response to the shortage of researchers trained in AI, Northeastern seeks postdoctoral candidates from computer science and other fields related to Artificial Intelligence. 
 
Last year, Northeastern launched a pioneering research and innovation hub in AIâ€”one that will shape the way humans and machines collaborate. Led by Dr. Usama Fayyad, the Experiential AI Institute is built around the challenges and opportunities made possible by human-machine collaboration. The institute provides a framework to design, implement, and scale AI-driven technologies in ways that make a true difference to society. Our ability to respond to the opportunities afforded to society will depend on training and building a workforce that is AI-capable. Headquartered in Portland, Maine, with the goal of growing the Maine tech economy, the Roux Institute will be the main center of activity for the Experiential AI Instituteâ€™s efforts, in addition to efforts in other campuses. 
 
 Responsibilities: 
 
During a two-year postdoctoral appointment, Experiential AI Postdoctoral Fellows will be mentored by members of Northeasternâ€™s Experiential AI faculty or faculty from other colleges affiliated to the institute. Of particular interest is AI applied to cybersecurity, life sciences, healthcare informatics information retrieval, and responsible/ethical AI. 
 
After this period, at the conclusion, if successfully evaluated, may be considered for faculty and staff research appointments at the Roux Institute or at one of Northeasternâ€™s other seven US campuses (Boston, Burlington, Charlotte, Nahant, Seattle, San Francisco, and San Jose). 
 
 Qualifications: 
 
The successful candidate should have a Ph.D. in computer science, AI, or related topics by the time of appointment. Candidates are not required to have any prior working experience. We expect postdoctoral fellows to establish and advocate for best practices in scientific reproducibility of all results, and to promote the ethical use of data and algorithms. 
 
Salary Grade: 
 
 10 
 
 Additional Information: 
 
Applications will be accepted and evaluated on a rolling basis, with the evaluation starting May 18, 2021; successful applicants to this program will begin their appointments on September 1, 2021 or later.
