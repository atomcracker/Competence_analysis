About Zapata Computing: 
 
Zapata Computing, Inc. is a quantum software, services, and applications company with a mission to accelerate the quantum revolution. We are developing a quantum workflow platform to solve critical problems across a wide range of industries. Zapataâ€™s quantum platform Orquestraâ„¢ combines a powerful software engine and quantum algorithm libraries to deliver real-world solutions across a full range of classical and quantum technologies. 
About the job : 
 
The Zapata Quantum AI team is building a portfolio of next-generation quantum machine learning tools and algorithms to be deployed on state-of-the-art hardware through Orquestra, Zapataâ€™s workflow management platform. A few examples of the Quantum AI teamâ€™s recent work: 
 
 Quantum-inspired models for enhanced combinatorial optimization (arXiv:2101.06250). 
 Generative modeling with quantum-classical hybrid architectures (arXiv:2012.03924). 
 Data-driven initialization and analysis techniques for parametrized quantum circuits (arXiv:2103.08572). 
 
 As a Machine Learning Engineer, you will work with the team to benchmark novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithms against state-of-the-art classical techniques and develop, product-ionize, and maintain these algorithms and tools. We are looking for someone with a proven track record in classical machine learning who is eager to learn about quantum computing, to team up with Zapataâ€™s quantum scientists and researchers to build the next generation of hybrid quantum-classical AI technologies. Some experience with quantum algorithms is preferred but not necessary for this position. 
Key responsibilities include: 
 
 Design, create, test, and maintain a suite of classical machine learning and optimization techniques that clients and researchers can deploy on Orquestra to benchmark against novel hybrid quantum-classical innovations. 
 Collaborate with DevOps and Platform Engineers to propose and build tooling, data management, and model management features for the machine learning lifecycle. 
 Participate in fast-paced research in machine learning and quantum computing applications. Be a voice for the latest research in classical ML, to continually consider new ideas and opportunities in hybrid quantum-classical AI. 
 Collaborate with colleagues and clients to provide feedback on active machine learning projects and analysis of results. 
 Contribute to integrating proprietary and state-of-the-art quantum machine learning algorithms to be used by our customers and academic users. 
 
 Required Knowledge/Skills/Abilities: 
 
 BS degree in science or engineering related to artificial intelligence research or machine learning applications. 
 2+ years of experience applying machine learning models for real-world use cases. 
 Experience with modern software languages like Python, Julia, Go, or C/C++. 
 Experience using machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) or MLOps platforms (e.g., MLFlow, Kubeflow). 
 Ability to formulate machine learning architectures for tackling real-world problems. 
 
 Desired Knowledge/Skills/Abilities: 
 
 Industry experience in one or more of the following ML tasks: classification, pattern recognition, or generative modeling. 
 Experience with the software development lifecycle and related best practices. 
 Experience with container technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. 
 Experience working with teams in a cross-functional setting. 
 Knowledge or experience with quantum computing.
