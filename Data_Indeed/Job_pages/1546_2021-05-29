The Osmanbeyoglu lab is looking for a Bioinformatician who would work on cutting-edge and clinically relevant problems in cancer biology using genome-wide methods and applied machine learning. The lab focuses on developing statistical and machine learning methods for single cell multi-omics integration. Projects are in the areas of cancer genomics, epigenetics of drug response, and immunotherapy and are executed through multi-disciplinary collaborations. The Bioinformatician must be proficient with R, Python, MATLAB, and Unix/Linux and software repositories such as Git. The Bioinformatician must have independent experience in data science (machine learning) by having implemented such analyses with multi-omics/clinical data. Must possess expert knowledge of machine-learning and statistics in particular. The ability to design and implement analytic software is required. Experience with best practices in modern software development, including agile development practices, source-code control systems, testing and test-driven development, code reuse and API design and documentation is highly-desirable. As a member of a team conducting novel biomedical cancer research, the Bioinformatician will need to look beyond the code, building a deep understanding of the problem domain and resulting implications for software design and independent analytic approach. Detailed work with collaborating scientists and other stakeholders will be required, often with the implicit requirement of learning the details of a new and unfamiliar field.
