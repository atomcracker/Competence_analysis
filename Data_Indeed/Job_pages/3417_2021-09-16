 Search Extended
 The Discovery Partners Institute provides a platform for people to jumpstart their tech careers or companies in Chicago. Led by the University of Illinois System in partnership with local and global research universities, DPI does three things: tech talent development, applied R&D, and business development. DPI prepares students and workers to step into high-demand tech jobs. It also builds research teams helps them to identify and pursue new funding opportunities. With state investment and a new urban innovation district in development just south of the Chicago Loop, DPI has the resources to attract, develop and leverage the most ambitious people and companies the region has to offer - and keep them here. 
 DPI invites nominations and applications for the position of Research Associate/Senior Research Associate. This role offers an opportunity to help shape and drive one of DPI's core missions: Research & Development (R&D). They are expected to participate in research project design, development and execution through the production of independent research and by taking ownership of sub-projects within large multi-faceted R&D efforts. They should provide creative ideas and direction for their assigned projects and are expected to take initiative. Topics for research will vary but will be primarily related to computing and may include a range of approaches including AI/ML, IoT, cloud-based computing, statistics, simulations, and cybersecurity. DPI is especially interested in supporting research that is grounded in practice and has commercialization potential. 
 Research Associates must demonstrate independence in executing a particular research effort. They must be familiar with data collection, data analysis, programming (one or more languages), have subject-matter expertise in one or more areas, and have good verbal and written communication abilities necessary to produce scholarly work in scientific conferences as well as produce results that meet the professional demands of the industrial sectors. Research Associates are expected to work closely with both our internal R&D team members as well as collaborators in University of Illinois and with other DPI partner institutions.
