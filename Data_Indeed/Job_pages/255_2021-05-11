POSITION SUMMARY 
 
The Michael Group in the Plant Biology Laboratory at the Salk Institute focuses on sequencing and analyzing plant genomes. The Bioinformatics Analyst I (BAI) position will work closely with the PI and other members of the lab to analyze plant genome data generated in the lab. The BAI will be responsible for executing and maintaining current analysis pipelines, building new analysis pipelines, and integrating new genomics tools when appropriate. The BAI will also work closely with members of the lab and larger Plant Biology group to interpret genomics data as well as assist in non-pipeline bioinformatics applications. 
 
There will be a specific focus on assembling plant genomes from Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long read sequencing technologies. The BAI will stay current on best practices and update the genome assembly pipelines according to advances in the sequencing technologies. The BAI will develop gene prediction strategies and ensure that the gene prediction pipeline integrates appropriate data types to ensure high quality gene models. In addition to genome assembly and analysis, the BAI will be responsible for analyzing and integrating multi-omic data sets such as resequencing, single cell, ATAC-seq, and DNA methylation. 
 
Other efforts will include the collection, integration and analyses of plant multi-omic data to enable discovery by lab-based biologists. The BAI will also work with scientists to visualize their data and develop high quality figures for papers when appropriate. The position will include presentation of scientific results to the larger Plant Biology Laboratory and scientific writing.
