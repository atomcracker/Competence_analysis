Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description Position Description: 
 The Division of the National Toxicology Program (DNTP), Comparative and Molecular Pathogenesis Branch (CMPB) is seeking highly motivated comparative pathologists with expertise in anatomic pathology and with a keen interest in understanding molecular mechanisms of toxicity and carcinogenesis. 
 
 The mission of the DNTP is to evaluate environmental substances of public health concern by developing and applying tools of modern toxicology and molecular biology. The DNTP provides critical data for regulatory and non-regulatory stakeholder decision making to protect human health by using animal studies, alternative  in vivo  and  in vitro  model systems, high-throughput screening and computational approaches to provide insights into the potential for substances in the environment to cause adverse health effects. 
 
 A major goal of the CMPB is to provide a translational and mechanistic context to pathology outcomes with the integration of various streams of scientific data. The primary role of the candidates will be to work across disciplines, be translationally-focused, and to partner with scientific teams within the institute for the integration of  in vitro ,  in vivo  and computational data for predicting and understanding the pathogenesis of disease processes. The candidate will be exceptionally collaborative, innovative in their thinking and be expected to contribute to DNTP efforts to reinvent the way toxicology is practiced. 
 
 The candidate will also contribute to pathology evaluations for the standard DNTP studies and specialized studies such as cardiotoxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity. Furthermore, the candidate will have opportunities to contribute to advancing pathology capabilities in areas such as molecular pathology, digital pathology, morphometry and machine learning/artificial intelligence. In addition, the candidate will have the opportunity to participate in the global toxicologic pathology training program. 
 
 Qualifications: 
 Candidates for this position must have a DVM or equivalent medical degree. While not required, a PhD in Pathology or equivalent field and board certification in Anatomic Pathology by the American College of Veterinary Pathologists or equivalent are preferred. 
 
 Expertise in anatomic and comparative pathology is critical for this position. Well qualified candidates will demonstrate established interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms of toxicity and carcinogenesis. Communications skills, as evidenced by scientific presentations, publications in peer reviewed journals, or institutional reports and the ability to work within a team environment and a diverse group of stakeholders is highly desirable. 
 
 As a NIH Title 42 (g) Staff Scientist, the employee is generally appointed to a time-limited, renewable position. The position is open to all qualified applicants regardless of US citizenship or permanent resident status. The employee does not receive independent resources, although they will often work independently and have sophisticated skills and knowledge essential to the work of CMPB. 
 
 Salary/benefits 
 This is a federal full-time equivalent position, and a comprehensive benefits package is available. Salary will be commensurate with experience and qualifications.
