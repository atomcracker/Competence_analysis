Changing the world through digital experiences is what Adobeâ€™s all about. We give everyoneâ€”from emerging artists to global brandsâ€”everything they need to design and deliver exceptional digital experiences! Weâ€™re passionate about empowering people to create beautiful and powerful images, videos, and apps, and transform how companies interact with customers across every screen.
 
 
Weâ€™re on a mission to hire the very best and are committed to creating exceptional employee experiences where everyone is respected and has access to equal opportunity. We realize that new ideas can come from everywhere in the organization, and we know the next big idea could be yours! 
 
 The Opportunity
 Help us unlock information in documents, intertwine artificial intelligence and user experience, and invent the future â€“ across mobile and the cloud. We are seeking a Senior Product Manager who has a passion for combining emerging machine learning technologies and unproven ideas into shipping products, as well as the skills and experience to scale the product after first ship. By some estimates, at least 80% information created and used by enterprises is unstructured content, and much of this content lives in documents. The velocity of content creation and consumption grows at a breathtaking pace, and consumers, businesses and developers are looking for solutions that help them get more out of documents.
 If you are passionate about the application of natural language processing and computer vision to help people read and comprehend better, and businesses streamline workflows and unlock content to make better decisions, this is the role for you. Excited to join this adventure with us? Then we encourage you to apply!
 What you'll Do
 Ship category-defining products and services at the intersection of exciting business opportunities, hard product problems, ground-breaking technologies and delightful customer experiences. Here are a couple of examples of high-impact products recently shipped by this team:

 Identify new opportunities by routinely conducting customer research, while collaborating with design, engineering, and AI researchers to rapidly conceptualize, prototype, and validate new ideas.
 Use customer feedback, data analysis and focus on asking and answering the right questions to scale your product beyond first ship
 Deeply understand and synthesize technology and market developments to build business cases for organic and inorganic investments in new or adjacent product areas
 Routinely present product strategy and concepts to key influencers and senior leadership.
 What you need to succeed
 Zero to One and growth mentality: Experience and passion not just for bringing a new product to market but unlocking the next phase of growth, especially in consumer-facing mobile and web applications
 Curiosity: Strong desire to learn about new problem spaces and understand the "why", not just the "what"
 Savvy Innovator: Keen and flexible intellect with strong conceptual thinking, analytical, and problem-solving skills. Ability to evaluate alternatives qualitatively and quantitatively and make compelling recommendations on whatâ€™s right for the product.

 Top Notch Communicator: Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Ability to clearly communicate ideas, business rationale and implications to anyone from customers, engineers and designers, legal and marketing to C-level executives.
 Results-Oriented: Not afraid to roll up oneâ€™s sleeves and be inventive in getting the job done. Leads by example, holds self-accountable for performance, and champions all aspects of their initiatives.
 Leadership: Proven ability to lead both directly and through influence.
