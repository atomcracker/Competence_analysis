We've built a fearlessly experimental, customer-obsessed team who are making discoveries to fundamentally change how people build and consume business applications. 
 
Today, we're partnering with the world's leading companies to transform how they use data and technology. If these challenges excite you, we'd love to hear from you! 
 
Our Engineering Team  architects the underlying operating system, core services, platform infrastructure, dev toolkits, core algorithms, machine learning models, packaged end-user apps, and app store marketplace. Instabase engineers are excited to solve hard problems for complex organizations and are self-starters from day one. 
 
As a Software Engineer on the Explainable AI Team , you'll design and develop the next generation of glass-box artificial intelligence. We are bridging the human-machine gap in ML, enabling humans to understand, debug, and fine-tune models automatically generated by machine learning systems. 
 
What you'll do 
 
 Research, design, and implement program synthesis and modeling techniques for understanding documents from sparse datasets. 
 Build intuitive user interfaces for visualizing, tweaking, and debugging the internals of AI models. 
 Find heuristically performant solutions to NP-hard algorithmic problems. 
 Design data structures and APIs that span a deep and complex stack, from a sophisticated front-end down to a core inference engine. 
 
 About you 
 
 You're curious. You're into math or programming language design. 
 You enjoy thinking about how people think. You're excited to make something complex appear simple and intuitive to users. 
 You like getting to the bottom of deep, complex problems. You aren't satisfied with "it works" until you understand why. 
 We are pretty tech-agnostic, but use React/TypeScript on the front-end and will use OCaml or another FP language on the back-end. 
 If this sounds exciting, we'd like to hear from you. Domain/ML experience not expected.
