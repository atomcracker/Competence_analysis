Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence. 
We resonate with people who are looking for ways to go further and offer an opportunity to be part of a team of passionate and dedicated engineers working with some of the worldâ€™s best capabilities and cutting- edge technology in science, technology, and engineering. The pride of working at JPLâ€™s (NASA and Caltech) innovative work culture; we offer a comprehensive benefits plan, relocation, tuition reimbursement and generous Caltech retirement contributions. 
The Tracking Systems and Application Section provides world-leading capability and expertise in a wide range of technologies that are critical to spacecraft tracking and related applications. The Section supports algorithm development, calibration and validation of NASAâ€™s satellite altimeter missions as well as NASA's deep-space missions by providing to the JPL navigators unique and extremely precise radiometric sources and data types. The Section provides the Deep Space Network (DSN) with precision atomic frequency and time references and distribution systems. The Section is responsible in delivering to JPL navigators a host of products that are required for deep space navigation such as celestial and terrestrial reference frame coordinates, Earth orientation parameters, and calibrations to account for the effects of the Earth's troposphere and ionosphere on radiofrequency metric tracking data-types. The Section also performs extensive scientific investigations using its technologies in the areas of planetary dynamics, astrophysics, astrometry and radio astronomy, gravitational waves, geophysics, and fundamental physics. 
Responsibilities:
 We invite you to join the Tracking Systems and Applications Section within the Deep Space Tracking Systems Group (335D) to serve as an Active and Passive Research Scientist II. The primary responsibilities will be on the Europa Clipper Project where you will support the Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON) Investigation for the remainder of Phase C/D. You will also be the Investigation Scientist Assistant supporting the REASON Investigation Scientist and will be involved with research and development activities outside of Europa Clipper. 
Tasks Include: 
Europa Clipper Investigation Scientists are members of the Project Science Staff and have the following responsibilities and tasks in support of the Project and Deputy Project Scientists: 
Serve as science liaison between assigned investigation team and other elements of the Project and represent the investigation in Project meetings and discussions with the spacecraft and ground data systems, mission planning, science operations, science data management, education and public outreach; serve within the Project as the technical or scientific point of contact for an instrument to the science team and/or science community. Provide scientific advice and assessment to projects and/or programs for an instrument as a representative of the science team. 
Ensure that the investigation Principal Investigator (PI) is informed in a timely manner of all relevant Project activities and that the Project Science Office is informed in a timely manner of all relevant investigation Science Team activities; 
Facilitate the exchange of information between the PI and the investigation science teams and Project personnel at JPL and APL, as directed; 
Provide, in concert with the PI and his/her investigation team, assessments of possible impacts on the investigation science and recommendations for actions by the Project, including preparation and submittal of formal change requests; coordinate resolution, as assigned by the Project or Deputy Project Scientist, of science issues between the assigned investigation team and other elements of the Project;
