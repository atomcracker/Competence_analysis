 Job Overview:
 Qualcomm is a company of inventors that unlocked 5G ushering in an age of rapid acceleration in connectivity and new possibilities that will transform industries, create jobs, and enrich lives. But this is just the beginning. It takes inventive minds with diverse skills, backgrounds, and cultures to transform 5Gs potential into world-changing technologies and products. This is the Invention Age - and this is where you come in.
 GENERAL SUMMARY
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing industries, products, and core capabilities by delivering dramatically enhanced experiences. The field of AI, especially deep learning, has tremendous opportunity for explorations and improvements.
 
At Qualcomm AI Research, we are advancing AI to make its core capabilities – perception, reasoning, and action – ubiquitous across devices. Our mission is to make breakthroughs in fundamental AI research and scale them across industries. By bringing together some of the best minds in the field, we’re pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and shaping the future of AI.
 
 
Led by world-renowned pioneering machine learning researcher, Max Welling, members of our team enjoy the opportunity to participate in cutting edge research while simultaneously contributing technology that will be deployed worldwide in our industry-leading devices. You will be part of a multi-disciplinary team that has repeatedly won major deep learning competitions.
 
Collaborate in a cross-functional environment spanning hardware, software and systems. See your design in action on industry-leading chips embedded in the next generation of smartphones, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and IOT devices. Come join a high-caliber team of engineers building advanced machine learning technology, best-in-class solutions, and user friendly model optimization tools such as Qualcomm Innovation Center’s AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (https://github.com/quic/aimet) to enable state-of-the-art networks to run on devices with limited power, memory, and computation
 
Role responsibility can include both, applied and fundamental research in the field of machine learning with development focus in one or many of the following areas:
 
Conducts fundamental machine learning research to create new models or new training methods in various technology areas, e.g. deep generative models (VAE, Normalizing-Flow, ARM, etc), Bayesian deep learning, equivariant CNNs, adversarial learning, active learning, Bayesian optimizations, unsupervised learning, and ML combinatorial optimization using tools like graph neural networks, learned message-passing heuristics, and reinforcement learning.
 
Drives systems innovations for model efficiency advancement on device as well as in the cloud. This includes auto-ML methods (model-based, sampling based, back-propagation based) for model compression, quantization, architecture search, and kernel/graph compiler/scheduling with or without systems-hardware co-design.
 
Performs advanced platform research to enable new machine learning compute paradigm, e.g., compute in memory, on-device learning/training, edge-cloud distributed/federated learning, and quantum machine learning.
 
Creates new machine learning models for advanced uses cases and achieve state-of-the-art performance and beyond. The use cases can broadly include computer vision, audio, speech, NLP, image, video, power management, wireless, graphics, and chip design
 
Design, develop & test software for machine learning frameworks that optimize models to run efficiently on edge devices. Candidate is expected to have strong interest and deep passion on making leading-edge "deep learning" framework and algorithms working on mobile/embedded platforms for the benefit of end users.
 
Research, design, develop, enhance, and implement different components of machine learning compiler for HW Accelerators.
 
Design, implement and train DL/RL algorithms in high-level languages/frameworks (PyTorch and TensorFlow).
