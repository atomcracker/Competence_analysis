 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search AI Applications Engineer Graphcore Palo Alto, CA OVERVIEW 
 
Graphcore has created a completely new processor, the Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU), specifically designed for artificial intelligence. The IPU's unique architecture means developers can run current machine learning models orders of magnitude faster. More importantly, it lets AI researchers undertake entirely new types of work, not possible using current technologies, to drive the next great breakthroughs in general machine intelligence. 
 
We believe our IPU technology will become the worldwide standard for artificial intelligence compute. The performance of Graphcore's IPU is going to be transformative across all industries and sectors whether you are a medical researcher, roboticist or building autonomous cars. 
 
Our team is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence revolution, enabling innovators from all industries and sectors to expand human potential with technology. What we do really makes a difference. 
 
As an AI Applications Engineer you will be working as part of Graphcore's Engineering team implementing & optimizing state-of-the-art machine learning applications using our PoplarTM SDK and IPU technology. Your work will encompass all elements of the ML application development lifecycle – including ML algorithms, convergence characteristics and computational throughput optimization, and workloads scaling from a single IPU to thousands of IPUs. You will be contributing to our open source Examples portfolio, in addition to working with our open source PyTorch, TensorFlow and PopLibs implementations.. 
 
Our work supports & enables engagements with some of the world's top machine learning innovators at deep learning research groups, at academic institutions, at innovative machine learning start-ups, at leading automotive companies, and at some of the world's largest cloud and internet companies.
