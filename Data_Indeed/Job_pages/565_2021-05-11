Who we are: 
Whiterabbit.ai was founded in 2017 by Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur Rakesh Mathur and Stanford trained medical imaging researcher Jason Su. 
We are developing a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) suite to significantly reduce late-stage breast cancer by detecting it in its earliest stages and eliminate suffering. 
We hope through developing robust AI technologies, we can improve the speed and accuracy of cancer detection in radiology. Our solutions in development are aimed at redesigning the entire breast cancer screening process with a focus on compassion. By redefining and shortening the screening and diagnosis experience for women, we aim to improve their patient experiences and outcomes. 
This is an exciting time to be a part of the Whiterabbit team. If you are passionate about eliminating suffering in others, have a mind for innovation, and want to help spread our mission, this is the place for you.
