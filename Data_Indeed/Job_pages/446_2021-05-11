 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Intern â€“ AI Robustness Siemens 9,995 reviews Princeton, NJ 08540 Siemens 9,995 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. Job details Job Type Full-time Temporary Internship Full Job Description We are currently seeking a Summer Intern in the field of Robust AI Verification of Intelligent Systems to investigate and develop approaches for automated verification of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The challenge of our research project is to demonstrate the robustness of AI systems against adversarial attacks. Especially, we are interested in detecting and measuring flaws originating from the training of a robust classifier. Approaches of a similarity and sensitivity analysis of training data shall be analyzed towards their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. The internship will focus on the development of approaches to analyze and measure the robustness of ML models and demonstrated by a PoC of the verification approach. 
At the core of Siemensâ€™ business are complex software-intensive systems that apply AI technology. Siemens factory automation, smart building, power grid control, and other technologies depend on the robust operation of those AI-based software systems. Thus, the verification of AI-based systems has become a lot more challenging. Methods to ensure safe and reliable operation for traditional industrial systems are no longer sufficient. Thus, it is essential for the future success of our businesses to advance the state of the art and enable the use of artificial intelligence in the industrial domain. 
 The Challenge 
 Review available academic literature to create an overview about existing approaches and results, as well as directions in academic research 
Select a subset of existing approaches and devise a strategy to create a Proof of Concept to allow further assessment of feasibility for automation 
Present and discuss results within the research team 
 The Candidate: 
 Qualified candidates will have/be: 
A current student pursuing a MS/PhD degree in Computer Science / Data Science / Software Engineering, or other related subject with a strong focus on Formal Verification 
Solid software development skills (i.e., Python) and experience with AI development frameworks (i.e., Tensorflow) 
Solid knowledge about and experience with Data Analytics methods, especially Machine Learning. 
Experience with Adversarial Attack techniques and how to improve classification results or reduce misclassifications preferred. 
Experience in evaluating and improving the robustness of intelligent systems. 
Experience with standard software development processes, methodologies, and best practices (including requirements analysis, software architecture and design, and verification) 
Background on ML learning theory is a plus 
Excellent knowledge of English (spoken and written)
