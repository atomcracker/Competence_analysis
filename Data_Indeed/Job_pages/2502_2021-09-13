 You enjoy working with people and can put yourself in other people's shoes. You're not afraid to ask for help when you need it or help teammates when they need a boost.
 You believe in strong opinions, weakly held-- you're not afraid to change your opinion in the face of new facts and acknowledge what you don't know.
 Are intensely curious about finding a solution to the pain-points of our passengers along the entire travel experience
 Have a sense of ownership in everything you build, and drive for continuous improvement
