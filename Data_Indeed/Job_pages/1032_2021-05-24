 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Senior Software Engineer, Applied AI OpenAI San Francisco, CA Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description Join the API team, a core group who work to bring OpenAI's technology to the world in partnership with other organizations. 
 
We are looking for a self starter engineer who loves building and running production systems. In this role, you will build the systems that power a breadth of production ML use cases. Youâ€™ll also work closely with and directly accelerate machine learning researchers, but don't need to be a machine learning expert yourself. We value people who can quickly obtain a deep technical understanding of new domains, and enjoy being self-directed and identifying the most important problems to solve. 
We look for a track record of the following: 
Experience designing, implementing, and running production services. 
Comfort managing and monitoring infrastructure deployments. 
Willingness to debug problems across the stack, such as networking issues, performance problems, or memory leaks. 
Experience with high-performance computing or infrastructure orchestration tools are a bonus. 
You might be a good fit if you: 
Are self-directed and enjoy figuring out the most important problem to work on. 
Own problems end-to-end, and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done. 
Know your way around a Unix shell. 
Build tools to accelerate your own workflows, but only when off-the-shelf solutions would not do. 
Have been a startup founder or an early-stage engineer. 
Enjoy fast paced work environment with tight feedback loops. 
On this team you will be expected to balance building new components while improving the foundation on which it all runs. The codebase is currently a mix of Go and Python. Our services run on multiple Kubernetes clusters, and the clusters are versioned in Terraform. We always aim to deploy reliable systems with low error rates and redundancy built in. Weâ€™re only getting started building the API, and would like you to join to help build the rest of it!
