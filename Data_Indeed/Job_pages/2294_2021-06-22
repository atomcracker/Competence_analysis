 We are seeking a dynamic Strategy & Planning Manager with experience managing multiple business initiatives and stakeholder engagements (communicate, collaborate, adopt), by leading high-priority projects from creation to delivery to scale.
 This is an exciting opportunity for a highly motivated individual to become a key member of the global Strategy & Planning team, working in close partnership with colleagues across the entire Sales organization to deliver insights that will drive focus, enablement, and accountability that are integral to AppDynamics’ business growth.
 The role requires someone with a strong background in change management, with a proven ability to break down complex problems, translate ambiguity into action, and foster business interlock and common outcomes across AppDynamics and Cisco.

 Provide key insights to the Sales organization by helping translate business and financial goals into new capabilities and operating models
 Develop common systems and outcomes to track objectives and milestones across Sales Operations teams (e.g. Partner Operations, Field Operations, Revenue Operations)
 Partner with AppDynamics and Cisco stakeholders to ensure alignment on high- priority growth areas for the Sales Organization
 Manage ad hoc requests for Strategy & Planning support from the Sales organization
 Collaborate with peers across the business to improve the overall effectiveness of our Go-to-Market activities
 
Who You Are
 5+ years of relevant experience in a Strategy & Planning role for a SaaS company, and/or Consulting, preferably with a focus in Market Strategy and competitive benchmarking
 Strong background in Change Management, Program Management, and/or Project Management, ideally coupled with Sales Operations experience
 Ability to define and direct multiple workstreams, and drive clarity and consensus across all levels of an organization
 Strong organizational planning skills, enterprise portfolio management concepts, and strategic roadmap development
 Meticulous attention to detail; ability to navigate high, deep, and broad across a diverse workforce and various geographies
 Highly collaborative and proactive, with ability to leverage expertise across teams, partner with Sales and cross-functional leaders, and drive complex initiatives to completion
 Hard-working team player, excellent communication skills, positive attitude, and strong work ethic
 
 Why AppDynamics + Cisco?: 
The world is changing. Today, people and devices are more connected than ever before, raising the bar for performance and the customer experience alike. At AppDynamics, we’re unified in our mission to empower enterprises with an AI-powered application performance monitoring solution that provides visibility and insight into the IT environment, as well as unified monitoring down to the network, so you can make mission critical and strategic decisions that drive business forward in real-time. When AppDynamics was acquired by Cisco for $3.7B it was the day before we were planning on going public. This strategic acquisition was 2.4 times more than we were planning to exit at, which highlights how much Cisco values the AppDynamics business. So, why did they invest so much in us? As part of Cisco, AppDynamics will serve a critical role in helping drive Cisco's continued transformation into a software company. Being a part of the Cisco family allows us to benefit everyone - We do all of this while striving for a culture that empowers every person to be the difference, at work and in our communities.
