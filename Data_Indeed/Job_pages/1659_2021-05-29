Cures Start Here.  At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutchâ€™s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nationâ€™s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network.  Careers Start Here. 
At Fred Hutch, we believe that the innovation, collaboration, and rigor that result from diversity and inclusion are critical to our mission of eliminating cancer and related diseases. We seek employees who bring different and innovative ways of seeing the world and solving problems. Fred Hutch is in pursuit of becoming an antiracist organization. We are committed to ensuring that all candidates hired share our commitment to diversity, antiracism, and inclusion. 
 
 
The Geraghty Lab seeks an exceptionally skilled, experienced molecular biologist to join their team. A summary of Dr. Geraghty's research can be found here. 
Responsibilities:
 
The  Staff Scientist  will work in a research laboratory that performs state of the art genotyping for disease association studies. The laboratory collaborates with local and international labs to carry out anthropological, clinical, and basic disease studies that are aimed at a better understanding and development of data and tools for diagnosis and treatment of a variety of human diseases. 
A core goal is to facilitate the use of immune genetic data both as a predictive tool in anticipating clinical outcomes ( diagnosis ) and as knowledge and information relevant to the biological processes causal of those outcomes ( therapeutics .) Precisely such application has long been active in support of hematopoietic cell transplants (HCTs) and plans are to expand and extend use to infectious disease, autoimmunity, and cancer. This work includes two fronts in expanding the genetic testing capacities of our genotyping systems and developing new analytic capabilities for data application. Novel typing systems focusing on heretofore untested immune response variation are being developed by building on the core systems supporting HLA. For novel analytics, study cohorts have been assembled to apply machine learning/artificial intelligence tools to identify patterns of immune genetic variation predictive of clinical outcomes in HCTs (for replication with and extension with new methods and added data) and for COVID-19 as a model of infectious disease. 
Qualifications:
 
A PhD in a biological science or related with an understanding of the fundamentals of molecular genetics is required. Familiarity with the genetics of the immune response would be a significant advantage â€“ in particular with the HLA system. To be successful in this position, one must have the ability to communicate effectively with coworkers, working together in executing tasks that engage multiple complementary activities in parallel. In addition to benchwork, these activities include data analysis and effective interaction with the laboratoryâ€™s software and data analysis group. The ability and willingness to take initiative in problem solving and suggestions for workflow improvements will be a key to advancement and associated benefits. 
A  statement  describing your commitment and contributions toward greater diversity, equity, inclusion, and anti-racism in your career or that will be made through your work at Fred Hutch is requested of all finalists.
