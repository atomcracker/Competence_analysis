Job Summary 
 
 The School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology invites applications for multiple openings at the Assistant Professor level (tenure-track); exceptional candidates at the Associate Professor and Professor level also will be considered. CSE focuses on foundational research of an interdisciplinary nature that enables advances in science, engineering, medical, and social domains. Applicants are expected to develop and sustain a research program in one or more of our core areas: high-performance computing, scientific and numerical computing, modeling and simulation, discrete algorithms, and large-scale data analytics (including machine learning and artificial intelligence). 
All areas of research will be considered, especially: scientific artificial intelligence (AI methods unique to scientific computing), urban computing (enabling effective design and operation of cities and urban communities), application-driven post-Mooreâ€™s law computing, and data science for fighting disease. Applicants must have an outstanding record of research and a commitment to teaching. 
Applicants are expected to engage in substantive research with collaborators in other disciplines. For example, current faculty have domain expertise and/or collaborations in computational chemistry; earth sciences; biomedical and health sciences; urban systems and smart cities; social good and sustainable development; materials and manufacturing; and others. 
Georgia Tech is organized into six Colleges. The School of Computational Science and Engineering resides in the College of Computing along with the School of Computer Science and the School of Interactive Computing. Joint appointments with other Schools in the College of Computing as well as Schools in other Colleges will be considered. 
The application material should include a full academic CV, a personal narrative on teaching and research, at least three references, one sample publication that is considered a very significant research contribution, and the names of 2-3 CSE faculty members closest to the applicant's research (see  https://www.cse.gatech.edu/people/faculty  for current faculty).
