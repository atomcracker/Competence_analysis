 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Software Engineer, Data Science, Trucking Waymo 26 reviews Mountain View, CA Waymo 26 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to get where theyâ€™re going. Since our start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has been focused on building the Worldâ€™s Most Experienced Driver in hopes of improving the world's access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. Our Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, our fully autonomous ride-hailing service, as well as Waymo Via, our trucking and local delivery service. To date, Waymo has driven over 20 million miles autonomously on public roads across 25 U.S. cities and conducted over 20 billion miles of simulation testing. 
As Waymo is becoming a multi-product company, Trucking is our second largest opportunity and will see massive growth in 2020. We believe that commercial trucking, the backbone of our economy, stands to reap untold benefits by deploying autonomous trucks, particularly during long-haul stretches. Roads will be safer. Goods will be cheaper. Truckers will be called upon to use their skills in new ways while the truck itself becomes a trusted navigation partner.
