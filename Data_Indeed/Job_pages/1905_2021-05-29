They are experts in the informatics methods used to analyze and translate data into consumable information and knowledge and have deep knowledge of healthcare data types, topics, approaches, and scientific challenges. You will work with subject matter experts and data scientists, software developers, and knowledge engineers to architect translational solutions that derive and represent the knowledge useful to customers. This requires you to have a deep understanding of the ways in which information (i.e. meaningful data) is converted into knowledge. 
As AI evolves and new methods of deriving knowledge are discovered, you will need to identify and develop solutions for new knowledge representations, algorithms and methods that are understandable in clinical practice. This requires a mastery of architecting newly derived knowledge into workflows and will involve designing or redesigning software applications to optimize understanding, utilization, data management, and analysis as required. You will be expected to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms in production use and optimize these processes to ensure successful adoption. 
You will study and develop models to translate clinical data, information and knowledge for use by data scientists in complex analytics and algorithms. You will be an expert in the informatics methods used to analyze data and have a deep knowledge of healthcare data types, topics, approaches, and scientific challenges. 
This role requires deep knowledge of data governance principles and best practices, including nomenclature, provenance/pedigree, and data structures. Applies best practices in cataloging and indexing of datasets and algorithms. Takes leadership in development of policy for managing derived data.
 This is a full-time telework role.
