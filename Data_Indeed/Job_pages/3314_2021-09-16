 Detailed Job Description 
The Global Cybersecurity Institute (GCI) at RIT invites applications for a full-time GCI Fellow position. The GCI Fellow is a 2-year post-doctoral research position, starting in January 2022, to conduct collaborative research with GCI faculty across academic departments while closely mentored by a primary faculty advisor. The GCI fellow is expected to publish peer-reviewed papers, co-advise PhD students, and assist or lead in preparing research funding proposals to secure funding in collaboration with the faculty mentor and other GCI faculty. Teaching opportunities may be discussed as appropriate. We strive to provide the GCI Fellow with autonomy to conduct research while offering a comprehensive mentorship for academic and professional growth. 
 
We invite applications from candidates with strong research outputs in the broad areas of cybersecurity and privacy, including but not limited to: usable security, cryptography, software security, network and system security, cybersecurity analytics, and the intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. The successful candidate should have a PhD. degree in areas closely related to cybersecurity before starting at RIT. The candidate will be housed in a home department with the primary faculty advisor, and will be expected to collaborate across the academic departments affiliated with GCI to advance research and education in cybersecurity broadly for the growth of GCI. 
 
 Department/College Description 
Building on our strong existing cybersecurity academic, research and industrial programs, RIT is making another major investment in cybersecurity. Leveraging a recent gift of $20 million by alumnus Austin McChord and a $5 million investment by New York State we just opened a new 50,000-sq. ft. building dedicated to the new Global Cybersecurity Institute (GCI), helping to further establish RIT as a leader in this field. Beyond our state-of-the-art new cybersecurity facility with unique capabilities like our commercial grade Cyber Range and our wireless and IoT testing labs these gifts support the hiring of faculty, graduate students and post doctorate positions. Currently, we have 27 faculty members from across RIT working to address the growing challenges in cybersecurity with an interdisciplinary approach and are actively recruiting for several more.
