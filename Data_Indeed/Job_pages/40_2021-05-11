The Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering at the University of Florida (UF) invites applications for a full-time, nine-month tenure track faculty position at the rank of Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), or the Department of Computer & Information Sciences & Engineering (CISE), or Engineering School for Sustainable Infrastructure and the Environment (ESSIE). Candidates are sought whose research focuses on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Signal, Image, and/or Video (SIV) processing and who are interested in collaborative research with the Center for Coastal Solutions (CCS), housed within the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering. The CCS (https://ccs.eng.ufl.edu/) is developing new approaches to monitor and model the risks and impacts of coastal hazards, including but not limited to flooding, sea level rise, harmful algae blooms, invasive species, and pathogen outbreaks. LiDAR, FLIR, multi- and hyper-spectral images, multi-channel underwater acoustic data, and underwater fluorescence and Raman scattering signals are a few examples of data modalities of interest to the CCS. Engineers and scientists interested in multi-modal, multi-spatiotemporal-scale signal, image, and/or video analyses will find a wealth of opportunity for supportive and multi-disciplinary collaboration in this position. 
The University of Florida is the flagship campus of the State of Florida university system and is ranked as the #6 best public US university according to US News and World Report. UF recently announced a $70 million artificial intelligence partnership with NVIDIA to create an AI-centric data center that houses the world's fastest AI supercomputer in higher education. Of particular relevance to this new faculty position, the HWCOE is in the process of creating the programmatic backbone to UF‚Äôs efforts to change the future of education and workforce development through university-wide AI training and experiential learning efforts. The Department of ECE in the HWCOE is a vibrant, multidisciplinary highly collaborative environment, consistently ranked among the top departments for both graduate and undergraduate programs. It offers BS, MS and PhD degree programs with an enrollment of about 1200 full-time undergraduate students and 600 graduate students of which about 200 are PhD students. Currently, the ECE Department has 57 tenured/tenure-track faculty which include 17 IEEE fellows, 17 NSF CAREER Award winners, and 7 PECASE winners. The Department‚Äôs external research expenditures are at record high, $21M last year using the ASEE definition. The ECE graduate program ranks #17 among public ECE departments (#27 overall) according to U.S. News and World Report. The department leads several university-wide multidisciplinary institutes related to AI and Signal/Image/Video processing including the NSF Center for Big Learning, the Nelms Institute for the Connected World, and the Florida Institute for CyberSecurity (FICS) Research. 
The University of Florida Center for Coastal Solutions is leveraging innovative technologies, applied Artificial Intelligence, workforce training programs, and multi-sector collaboration to enable local communities, the state, and the nation to better track, forecast, mitigate, and prevent coastal hazards, improving the quality of life and economic health of coastal residents (see more at: http://ccs.eng.ufl.edu). In pursuit of this mission, the CCS, established in October 2020 and led by HWCOE faculty, is integrating expertise, resources, and workforce training capabilities drawn from across UF, ranging from the Warrington School of Business to Levin College of Law, College of Design, Construction and Planning, UF|IFAS, and the College of Medicine. The Center is applying an open-source model to developing solutions to the most pressing environmental, economic and public health hazards facing coastal communities, forming extensive and rich partnerships with the public and private sector to drive innovation.
