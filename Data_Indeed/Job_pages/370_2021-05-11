 What Where Find Jobs Advanced Job Search Cognitive Sensors Researcher IBM 30,707 reviews San Jose, CA 95101 IBM 30,707 reviews Read what people are saying about working here. Job details Job Type Full-time Full Job Description Introduction 
IBM Research Scientists are charting the future of Artificial Intelligence, creating breakthroughs in quantum computing, discovering how blockchain will reshape the enterprise, and much more. Join a team that is dedicated to applying science to some of today's most complex challenges, whether it‚Äôs discovering a new way for doctors to help patients, teaming with environmentalists to clean up our waterways or enabling retailers to personalize customer service. 
 
Your Role and Responsibilities 
The Cognitive Sensors team at IBM Almaden is developing a novel gas sensing platform based on the ‚Äúelectronic nose‚Äù (e-nose) concept, with the ambition of mimicking the human olfactory system. In this context, the output of an array of orthogonal sensors is collected, processed, and analyzed by AI to recognize a chemical signature of interest. The e-nose technology finds potential applications in many industry verticals, ranging from air quality monitoring, to food safety, to early diagnosis of various diseases. 
 
We are looking for a candidate to assist with the development of innovative gas sensing materials and their integration & testing. The primary focus will be on Metal Oxide Sensors (MOS) and secondary focus on other kinds of chemoresistive materials (e.g. conductive polymers). Although many MOS materials are already commercially available, there is still room for improvement in sensor composition, gas sensitivity, selectivity, as well as production cost. 
 
The sensor team at IBM Almaden Research Center is currently exploring new paths to innovative MOS materials. The project involves studying novel, industry friendly routes to MOS materials with unstudied compositions, morphologies, topographies etc. Following material preparation, extensive characterization is required to establish structure-property relationships. The successful candidate will also develop nanofabrication processes for sensors integration in an e-nose, and protocols to benchmark IBM sensors vs commercial ones. 
 
Required Technical and Professional Expertise 
 
Basic knowledge of porous materials science 
Thin film processing and characterization (SEM, XRD, ellipsometry etc.) 
English: intermediate 
Preferred Technical and Professional Expertise 
 
Previous exposure to nanofabrication processes (lithography, thin-film deposition, etch etc.) 
Basic knowledge of Python programming 
English: fluent 
Track record of scientific publications
