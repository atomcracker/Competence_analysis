 Social Sustainability and Inclusion Global Practice (GGP) Context 
 
The Social Sustainability and Inclusion Global Practice (SSI GP) helps countries tackle deep rooted social problems stemming from fragility, climate change, exclusion, and the digital age with people centered solutions that build on local values and institutions. The GP engages with citizens, communities, and governments to deepen resilience, build inclusion, and empower vulnerable and marginalized groups to have influence and voice. The GP prioritizes participatory, multi-sectoral approaches that build on norms and informal institutions to address social challenges and to build more inclusive, empowered communities. It also works across the Bank‚Äôs portfolio to implement the Environment and Social Framework (ESF) standards and strengthen inclusive development. In particular, the GP focuses on three opportunity sets: 
 
 Social inclusion:  Expanding opportunities for people who have been excluded from participating fully in markets, services, and society, because of their ethnicity, gender, disability, income, or religious or sexual orientation. 
 
 Resilience:  Deepening opportunities for people to thrive by building cohesive and resilient communities able to withstand divisions caused by inequality, violence, climate change, and other risks to their livelihoods. 
 
 Empowerment:  Creating opportunities for people to lead their communities, engage more fully in government, and shape their own futures. 
 
The overarching priority in the area of Data and Analytics in the Global Practice‚Äîorganized in the Data, Analytics and Digital Global Solution Group (DAD GSG) ‚Äî is to strengthen and expand the analytics that underpin our country dialogue, policy engagements, operations, social risk management across the Bank‚Äôs portfolio, and engagements on the global agenda exploiting traditional and new sources of data and analytical tools, including digital tools. 
 
 Key areas in the DAD GSG include: SSI core country diagnostics: consolidating and expanding a comprehensive, comparable, and systematic country diagnostic tool (SSI core country diagnostic) across the Global Practice regions and countries with which inform policy dialogue, portfolio development and additional analytical products.

Innovative analytical work drawing on new sources of data for social sustainability diagnostics. Identify new sources and tools for using big data, artificial intelligence (AI), spatial/satellite, social media, community generated data (mobile app) etc. to better understand trends in vulnerability and wellbeing at the community level and social perceptions related to social sustainability. This work includes exploring how to use data collected at the community level to assess impact of public programs and the role of community characteristics in influencing outcomes. Support development of new analytical tools and regional engagements on social sustainability, covering the impact of norms on agency and inclusion, drivers of women‚Äôs economic empowerment, impact of citizen engagement and social accountability on development outcomes, policy barriers to the inclusion of persons with disabilities, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) persons, , etc. This work would involve building partnerships with other GPs, including the Poverty GP‚Äôs behavioral sciences team as well as Health, Education, Climate change, Urban, Gender teams, among others. Community of Practice.
